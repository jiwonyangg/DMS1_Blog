# Self Reflection Questions
>**Task Outline**
>
>This session's homework task was to continue answering the questions listed in the presentation slides. Afterwards, we needed to start thinking about how we want to plan out our webpage and answer the following questions:
> 1. What kind of key words do you want the user to associate with the aesthetics of your webpage?
> 2. Who is the target audience?
> 3. What features will your audience want to see in your final webpage design?
> Finally, we also needed to start writing up a rough draft of an artist statement.

## Assignment 1 - Video Edit
**1. How did you approach the relationship between the sonic and visual components of your edit?**

From my storyboard, I had a vision of what I wanted to do with my sound and visual elements but because it was my first time doing video editing, I had to approach things in a more simplistic way. We also had to stick with what the brief said, so we couldn’t go over the top with experimenting with sound. For my project, sound helped the audience to realise what was happening, such as the glitching sounds signifying the struggles I was going through, despite the scene looking “normal”. But, I approached sound the last, because I wasn’t too sure with what the sound libraries had to offer.


**2. How did you decide on the footage that you used to shape your project?**

Because a requirement for the assignment was to draw up a storyboard explaining what our video self-portrait was going to depict, my filming was heavily dependent on what I drew up on the storyboard. I was filming with the mindset that I would rather have too much footage to work with, rather than not enough, so, I filmed everything that I put on my storyboard. After this, I went through all of the footage that I had filmed and then chose which ones I liked the most. I added everything into a sequence on AdobePremiere and if I had trouble choosing between footage, I would add both and flip through back and forth to see which fit the overall picture better. I had ended up having to cut out a lot of scenes but I chose the footage based off of what I felt delivered the message best and most clearly. As I mentioned I had to cut a lot of scenes, I cut out the scenes that didn’t add onto the story, rather was just a filler. 


**3. What did you learn about the power of sound to shape emotional experience, and how did you apply this knowledge to your project?**

Prior to this project, I was aware of the impact sound had on video, but while editing I realised it could change the entire mood of the project. I found that it was actually quite fun experimenting with the sound, but because I didn’t have much time to properly experiment before submitting, so I couldn’t explore sound more. But for me, I think the biggest difficulty I had was maintaining the volume levels. I was aware -12 decibels was the standard level but it still felt too loud in some parts so I exported and edited multiple times.

**4. How does editing relate to the concepts of pacing and rhythm, and how did you use these concepts to shape your use of time in the project?**

I actually showed the passing of time visually, I had shots of a digital clock (on a computer screen) while filming shots of me “studying”. But I made the clips shorter, and therefore the cuts between shots shorter, to show the passing of time. Through the sounds I sourced, I slowed down the pace in the last portion of my video and had less cuts and more fading transitions to insinuate slower passing of time. I changed the pacing/rhythm in the middle of my video using various cuts in the video and audio, which then cut to black to mark the end of the first section’s pace/rhythm.


**5. Which parts of your personality, interests, past, and potential future did you choose to depict in your portrait?**

For my portrait, I chose to explore my transition into university, and transferring courses. I chose not to explore my personality and interests because I wasn’t confident in presenting a narrative, and I personally feel as though it’s not that interesting. I presented how I felt that studying was so repetitive and I was studying, but didn’t know what for and wasn’t sure where I was going to end up in the future. Then I showed my hesitation and fear moving into a new university and new course, but slowly walking through to show I’m prepared for change.

**6. What were the primary aesthetic choices that you made to express those ideas in your work?**

I focused on making the video as if someone was spying on my actions, incorporating scenes of my own point of view. If I were to discuss the visual aesthetic choices, I actually didn’t pay much attention because of the constraints of the brief. However, I did try to make sure the latter part of my video had more sunny scenes, to imply the idea of new beginnings. But I would definitely say that, out of all the assignments, I paid least attention to the visual aesthetics with the video because I was so fixated with staying within the constraints of the brief.


## Assignment 2 - Graphic Icons
**1. How would you summarise your idea behind the suite of icons, and why did you choose the theme that you did?**

The concept I chose for my icons was “community”. The idea I had behind my icons was that it would be icons within a game, where players would be able to choose a community of interest, related to Korean culture, and by choosing that community, they would receive a skin. 


**2. Did you iterate through a series of approaches before settling on one? What changed across those iterations, and why did you choose the one that you ended up with?**

From my initial icon sketches I traced all of the sketches in illustrator to create the outlines. Then I evaluated the problem areas and what I liked and didn’t like and made a more refined trace of the icons. After this, it was mainly choosing the specific hues and simplifying the icons more as I went. I had a very clear vision for the flipped icons so I didn’t have to do many iterations. I ended up choosing the designs based off of what I found cleanest/cohesive with each other and fitting to the theme I chose. I also made sure to choose the ones that fit according to the brief best.


**3. How did you translate your thumbnail sketches into the final flat designs in illustrator? Was anything lost in that translation, or gained?**

In the initial stages, I actually directly traced the thumbnail sketches I had. Because the sketches were rough, I had to do quite a bit of improvisation but it was still traced as best as possible. And because the icons were traced from the sketches I didn’t like the outcome, so I went back to further refine the icons in illustrator.


**4. How did you use colour to create a sense of unity and visual interest in the icons? Why did you choose the palette that you did?**

I tried limiting my colour palette as much as possible and I reused the colours throughout the entire design (for each set). I ended up with the colours I chose because it best represented my idea I wanted to portray and I felt that those were the most visually appealing options out of all the mock ups I had done. The colours were actually based off of the real life counter-parts so I ended up with more colours than I had hoped for but I faced some difficulty with certain icons becoming quite confusing with a heavily limited colour palette. But I knew that incorporating red and blue was a must (Korean flag colours).


**5. How did the elements and principles of sound that you used in your audience design correspond to the elements and principles of design that you used in your visual design?**

I  focused on choosing sounds that were accurate to the real-life counterparts. I think I didn’t focus too much on how they sounded together, so now looking back on it, it feels a bit chaotic because the sounds don’t relate to one another but at the time I wanted to choose sounds that aligned to what it was like in real life. So I don’t think that I did anything on corresponding with the elements and principles.


**6. How did you translate the prompt that you chose from an abstract idea to a set of concrete visual designs?**

When I thought of my first set of ideas it was quite broad so there were so many things I could explore. However, in class I quickly realised that I needed to make it more specific and after I made it more specific that’s when I started getting a clearer vision on which direction I wanted to head towards. But if I had to choose a certain stage, I was quite set on the visual designs while doing the thumbnail sketches because I could see the various directions I could head in and, ultimately, I had the freedom to choose one certain design (for each icon).


## Assignment 3 - Virtual Environment
**1. How important was a working prototype to your design process? What did  it offer that process?**

A working prototype wasn’t actually that important for my design process. But the feedback for my prototype was actually very helpful for further development, although most of the feedback I received, I was already planning on changing it for the final design. So I guess it balances out in the end, it was important to some degree but I was already thinking of those changes so it also wasn’t that big of a help for my design process. But the greybox prototype was very useful for me to realise that I didn’t like my original idea and needed to modify it.


**2. How did your experience of designing and producing a three-dimensional environment differ from your experience of designing and producing a project in two-dimensinoal media?**

I can say with confidence that designing a three-dimensional environment is so much more difficult than designing and producing a project in two-dimensional media. I was so grateful that we were allowed to source all of our assets because I was so confident I wasn’t going to finish before hearing that there was no limit in sourcing our assets. I think the reason why I found it so difficult was that I would think that I moved things to where I wanted it to be, but if I looked in another perspective it wouldn’t be where I needed it to be. It also didn’t help that I’ve rarely worked with 3D environments, whereas I’m quite familiar with 2D media.


**3. What was the role of the virtual camera in your project, and how was it similar to and different from the role of the camera in Assignment 1?**

It was both similar and different to the role of the camera in Assignment 1. However, in assignment 3, the virtual camera was completely a first-person point-of-view so it showed first hand my path and hardships, whereas in the video for assignment 1, I had a mix of first-person views and third-person perspectives. But both played a similar role in the sense that it was depicting my personal journey and path/hardships. 


**4. How did you use sound in your project, and how was this similar to and different from your use of sound in Assignments 1 and 2?**

I personally found sound the hardest to work with for this assignment, due to the 3D nature. For this assignment I really wanted to portray the eeriness in moving through the environment. On the other hand, assignment 1, because I was inexperienced with editing, I focused more on trying to follow the brief and show literally what was happening in my brain (through using sound). In a similar way, assignment 2 was also very literal and depicted the sounds of the real-life counterparts. Although I used literal sounds for my environment, such as a school bell ringing and dragging of a chair, I focused more on how I could make the user uncomfortable, rather than describing the scene with sound.


**5. How did you unify the different elements of your virtual environment under a certain theme or concept? How did your theme or concept evolve over the project's development?**

I purposely made a disconnect with the first and second half of my world. With my first world I made it unified by adding components that were very colourful and reminiscent of childhood and I was lucky enough to find an asset with an entire playground so I mainly only added the small details like the texture of the ground and some other assets that were relevant (and fit the colour scheme). For the second half of the world, I just made it as dark and “dirty” as possible, but using light really helped unify the elements because at first the trees were too green in comparison to the rest of the assets. 


**6. What did you discover through the process of play testing that you wouldn't have discovered otherwise?**

The main thing I was able to notice were the colliders. Some of the colliders didn’t exist, or would be slightly off. I also felt that my world felt very empty after doing a proper playthrough, although I know the draft didn’t have sound at this point in time. While I was building my world, I didn’t notice that the lighting was that bad, but during playtesting the first part of the world that’s meant to look sunny and happy, seemed very dark. It was also too easy for the character to fall off, which I was aware before playtesting, but it became more obvious after doing a playthrough. I also felt that last part of the world didn’t elicit much emotion so I contemplated adding more assets, which I ended up doing after receiving feedback. But overall, they were quite minor details that I didn’t notice during the building stages.


## Other Questions
**1. What kind of key words do you want the user to associate with the aesthetics of your webpage?**

I think my style tends to be quite geometric so I want the audience to associate the aesthetics as more clean/sleek and modern. Typically when you think of modern, minimalistic comes to mind, but I actually want to do something not too minimalistic because I personally think it can get quite boring. 


**2. Who is the target audience?**

I would hope the target audience to be others interested in design. In the future, I want to go into UX design, so if I’m being more specific it would be targeted towards either recruiters or simply people with an interest towards UX design.


**3. What features will your audience want to see in your final webpage design?**

I’m not too sure exactly what this question is asking for, but I would assume the audience would need to see details about myself and a design that reflects a bit of my design personality. (But I’m not too sure how to answer this question…)


## Artist Statement Draft
**Assignment 1**

In this self-portrait film, through audio-visual elements, I invite the viewer to journey through my path of change. Initially confidently starting a career in science, the repetition quickly tears down my hopes and confidence, leading to taking a step into the unknown and transferring to design. Through sound, I separated the piece into three sections, materialising the context in conjunction with the visuals; beginning with optimism, diverting to emptiness and finishing with feelings of contempt. The aesthetic decisions and footage derived from how I saw the world in my perspective and how others would perceive my work-life balance, work relating to schooling. I focused on presenting the world as is, and the dilemma happening within, becoming main determinants in choosing and piecing footage. Thus, this pairing of sonic-visual components created my first ever video edit: “Change.”


**Assignment 2**

Through these suite of nine responsive icons, the theme of “community” is expressed done in a flat-design style. I named this piece “freedom” because of the vast, unending possibilities of outcomes I could’ve unfolded the theme of community. I envisioned community within the context of a game, each icon representing a interest group inspired from Korean culture, once clicked allowing the user to obtain a skin to be used within the context of the game. Extensive brainstorming of concepts and icon designs lead to the ideation of the initial design, continuously iterated to harmonise with one another. The synthesis of colour and shapes provided grounds for a predictable audio, which were utilised to emphasise the original concepts and ideas of each of the icons.


**Assignment 3**

Based on my personal experience with moving schools and houses, this change and journey of growing up inspired “Realisation”, a navigable digital three-dimensional environment. Unlike previous pieces, the audio elements guided the user’s emotions, rather than being used to describe the scene occurring in the 3D environment. This piece is separated into two segments the first half illustrating an explorable playground, and the second materialising the image of what moving schools and growing up felt like, combined with sonic elements to elevate discomfort and fear. The merging of design elements and principles, spatial design and 3D design constructed this world physicalising the first emotional transition, parallel to the self-portrait film.

## Artist Biography Draft

>I was trying to make it longer, but whenever I added more sentences, I felt like I was repeating myself too much so I kept it short and snappy. But after writing this, I'm realising how hard it is to write something about myself.
