# Experimenting with Sound
>**Task Outline**
>
> After watching the Unity tutorials, we were to gather sound assets we wanted to use and continue iterating our 3D environment.

## Finding Sounds
Although this session's homework was focusing on finding sounds we wanted to use for our world, I wasn't too sure at this point in time which sounds to deliver in the environment so I decided to finalise the sounds once I received feedback for more inspiration (especially because I wasn't finished with my draft after taking a break from staring at the world too long).

I did, however, search through Youtube Audio Library for sounds of kids playing in a playground but I wasn't happy with what I found so I moved over to "Free Sound" and was able to successfully find a sound that I felt I could use.

I then searched up "School" and tried to find the most eerie, empty and creepy sounding tracks and came across these two sounds:

> - Short Alarm bell in school hall (some clock ticks etc).aif by sbyandiji -- https://freesound.org/s/217486/ -- License: Creative Commons 0

After feedback, I'll either utilise these sounds, or I'll continue to search for ones that are more fitting, but so far I'm quite satisfied with the simplicity of these sounds so I'm hoping that people testing will feel that the environment should utilise sounds like these. But as of now, I feel as though these sounds are the most fitting. I also don't want to overpower the environment with sound because I think that some sort of silence also works well with allowing the audience to let it sink in what change I want to portray.

## Continuing to Develop 3D Environment

In these screenshots I'm just continuing to move assets around, making sure to look from a variety of perspectives so that the assets don't get concentrated in one single area.

I started to play around a bit with lighting here, although it's not too obvious.

Here you can see that I added in a texture for the sky, and I continued to modify the positioning and size of my assets.

I got sick of moving around and adjsuting assets so I started drawing in the terrain details. You can't particularly see it from this screenshot, but, I placed an arch towards the beginning where I wanted the player to start because in class we were learning about how we should help orient the user and I realised I didn't have anything much to help the user know clearly where the starting point would be. Then the points of prospect of the elevated environment, the user can gain curiosity about what's to come, like progressive lures (although in my world the lures aren't visually-attractive, rather just pikes curiosity of what would be behind this building, or what would be beyong this hill).

When I was designing how the user could come down from the hill, I changed the layout to "2 by 3" instead of the default, so that I didn't have to constantly switch my screen back and forth. 
> Initially I downloaded a platform asset, but it was far too detailed and much bigger than I had anticipated (although I could adjust the size) and it didn't work as harmoniously with my other assets as I had hoped so I got the idea to use the chair/table as the stepping stones. It also made a bit more sense and foreshadowed the school that was to come after the house.

In these screenshots I'm adding the trees and making minor changes to the colour of the terrain.

Again, I'm just continuing to make small adjustments to the world, slowly working towards my draft environment. In the previous blog post you may have noticed that in the assets that I found there's a first person controller. At first, I wanted the user to suffer in going up the hill so I didn't want a jumping function, but because of the platforms the user needed to jump down, I thought that it was actually necessary to have the character jump, but I have having issues with the script so I found a good first person controller asset from the Unity Asset Store.
