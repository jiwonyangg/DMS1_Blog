# Experimenting with Sound
>**Task Outline**
>
> After watching the Unity tutorials, we were to gather sound assets we wanted to use for and continuing to iterate our 3D environment.

## Finding Sounds
Although this session's homework was focusing on finding sounds we wanted to use for our world, I wasn't too sure at this point in time how to deliver the sounds so I decided to finalise the sounds once I received feedback for more inspiration. 

I did, however, search through Youtube Audio Library for sounds of kids playing in a playground but I wasn't happy with what I found so I moved over to "Free Sound" and was able to successfully find a sound that I felt I could use.

I then searched up "School" and tried to find the most eerie, empty and creepy sounding tracks and came across these two sounds:

> - Short Alarm bell in school hall (some clock ticks etc).aif by sbyandiji -- https://freesound.org/s/217486/ -- License: Creative Commons 0
After feedback, I'll either utilise these sounds, or I'll continue to search for ones that are more fitting, but so far I'm quite satisfied with the simplicity of these sounds so I'm hoping that people testing will feel that the environment should utilise sounds like these. But so far, I feel as though these sounds are the most fitting. I also don't want to overpower the environment with sound because I think that some sort of silence also works well with allowing the audience to let it sink in what change I want to portray.
