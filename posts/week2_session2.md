# Experimenting with Audio

> **Task Outline**
> 
   > For homework we were required to continue watching tutorial videos, this time focusing on audio. The task required us to experiment with audio clips we had sourced for our own project.
> 
   > The task also required us to identify a key moment in our sequence and write a discussion.

## Audio Clip - Experimenting with Audio

Because I'm choosing to decide after editing my videos whether I prefer more diegetic sounds to be included or music to be the main focus, for this task I just combined the music that I plan to use.

I faded the audio in at the start, so that it doesn't become a jumpscare to the audience and then the audio continues as is. In hindsight, I'm realising that I need to edit some of the audio levels in between the track because of some inconsistencies in audio levels. I abruptly cut the audio in the middle, because this is where I wanted the scene of me throwing the papers off the table. (Frame #13 for reference below)

The track then continues to a something calmer and "empty", I chose this track because I felt as though it evoked a sense of feeling lost (and emptiness). I think I would prefer to have this slightly quieter because some of the sounds ring a lot. Following this, I faded the audio out a bit and then tried to abruptly start the next track because this is roughly where I'll place the clip of myself playing music (pressing unpause/play). (Refer to Frame #22 in the above storyboard image).

Although I didn't cut it at the best place, I cut the end of the audio because I liked where the audio stopped. I'm still in the midst of deciding whether I want it to slowly fade out or to be a sudden cut.

This exact edited soundtrack won't be used, however, it will follow a very similar sequence.

## Discussion
The most important part of my film, in terms of audio, will be during frame #11 - #13, where the screen flickers and then I throw all the papers off the table. (Refer to the images below for the specific frames). 
I haven't completely decided on the direction I want to go in terms of audio but I have two options:
1. Choose to abruptly cut the music where it flickers so that it's silent and then transition into the next song in the following scenes (similar to how the audio experimentation was doing)
2. Add a disconnecting type of SFX and include sounds of the papers dropping, cutting out the initial song, then fading into the next audio.
Either way, the aim is to show an abrupt moment, where I decide to halt my studying symbolising myself stopping studying at my previous course. 

I think both methods achieve the same effect but I'm just deciding which method I prefer, which I will test out while editing.

- **What is the emotional tone of the broadder portrait, and how are your editing choices going to support that tone generally?**

The emotional tone at this specific point in time is to evoke a sense of frustration and madness. This will then be contrasted with the calmer visual scenes following it. Essentially this is the climax of my film. I think the most important thing for me to do is make sure the black and white scenes properly give off the flickering effect and to emphasise the cut in the audio to highlight the frustrations that were being felt.

- **What does the audience need to understand about the relationship between shots in this moment? What connection are you trying to forge?**

If executed successfully, the audience will be understanding that, the point in which the papers are being thrown, is after days of continuous and repetitive studying and feeling sick of it and frustrated. The continuous studying will be shown in the previous shots where frame #8 mentions that there will be a repetition of scenes but faster-paced each repetition. The connection I want to forge afterwards is that I let go (the throwing paper scene) which will transition into being lost and then finding a new path - these feelings of frustration to being lost and found. I think this will be the most difficult to execute well in my audio sequence, as I also had difficulties earlier, while experimenting with my chosen audio, because it sounded very out of place.

- **What sort of rhythm, tempo, or pace are you attempting to establish during this moment? How will your editing produce this?**

During that moment, if I use method #1, I have to make sure that I cut the audio at a point in time where it sounds like it's disconnecting. If I choose method #2 then I just need to find a sound effect that I like and add it into the flickering scene, and then fade into the next song. 

I think the flickering scene will be the main highlight of the success of this climactic sequence because that is the main way that the rhythm, tempo and pace are being manipulated. However, the pace/tempo also shifts in frame #14 where I'm walking while being lost (in which the audio will help to slow down the pace). As previously mentioned, my main goal is to make sure that you can see the frustration and madness. 

Overall, my main objective is to decide which method will work more harmoniously with the visual elements and this will decide the success of how audio will contribute to my film.
