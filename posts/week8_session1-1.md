# Creating a 2D Image with 3D Shapes
>**Task Outline**
>
> During class there was an image of a bridge that was created using 3D objects and changing the perspectives. We were to imitate the image and document our process.
## Bridge

This was my final result of attempting to copy the image. As you can see in the work documentation photos below, I was constantly moving the elements back and forth. I also had to keep checking against the original image, changing the height/thickness as I went. Initially, I thought that it would be really quick and easy but it was harder than I thought to imitate. But it was overall a good activity to get me to get used to quickly changing the views and perspectives in unity. I also found that it was helpful to click on "Main Camera" to see a quick view of the scene, rather than clicking play which would require some loading time (although it wasn't long, it still helped to shorten the time because I was constantly adjusting the placement of the items).
