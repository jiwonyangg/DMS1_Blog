# Editing Sounds into Videos
## Task Outline
During class, everyone was assigned to a certain group and had to take a continuous 1-minute shot based on a theme. The themes were as follows: a chance encounter, escape, return, alone and a hard goodbye.

Once the videos were filmed we were to choose a video from another groups and edit sound onto the footage to enhance the visual elements through editing of sound.
