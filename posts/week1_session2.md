# Experimenting with Premiere Pro

**Task Outline**

   The homework task assigned was to watch through some tutorial/training videos on using Premiere Pro. During class we exchanged footage with one another, therefore obtaining 2, 30 second footage of each of our favourite space to experiment with (from Week 1, Session 1 homework task). We were asked to do the following:
   - What meanings can be produced via: Juxtaposition, Pacing & Rhythm (30 seconds)
   - Create a video that explores basic transitions

Because this was the first time I was ever exposed to Premiere Pro, I kept things very simple to start getting used to things. I wasn't too sure about how to explore Juxtaposition, Pacing and Rhythm all at once within 30 seconds, but I manipulated the speed of the footage and switched up the audio and visual footage for each clip (so my clip would have the audio of my classmates and vice versa). 

I went into this task with no thoughts at all and just freestyled - no plans. I think this honestly turned out for the better because I was really stuck on trying to show juxtaposition, pacing and rhythm at first that I took a long time to start the actual homework task. My biggest aim was to just finish the task with more familiarity of the program, not focusing too much on how perfect the outome of the 30 second video was. I just wanted to make sure that I had explored all the very basic editing techniques.

After reviewing the video, I wouldn't necessarily say that I'm proud? but definitely feel satisfied that I was able to produce something with my very limited knowledge of Premiere Pro, so I was somewhat successful overall. However, if I could do this task again, I would definitely try to experiment more with more cuts and try making it messier so that I can properly explore all the features there are.

## Video 2 - Transitions

In my opinion, I think this was much more fun to do, in comparison to the first video task just because it was so interesting to see how many different transitions were possible. Therefore, there was an endless amount of outcomes that were able to be made. We were told to experiment with the transitions of audio as well, but I mainly focused on the visual elements first, because I'm still not confident in my skills yet and still want to take some time to explore things step by step.

My aim going into this task was purely to have fun with the transitions so that I could see how these could be utilised in the main project, as there were limited editing techniques that were allowed to be used. I wanted to create something that wouldn't just be random cuts every second and have somewhat of a smooth transition across each clip. But I did find it a bit difficult to do any crazy experimenting just because the clips were both very grassy and green.

I really enjoyed this experimentation task and am somewhat satisfied with the outcome of the video, despite the visual similarity in terms of colour palettes etc. I still find the audio aspect to be quite difficult so I'm going to have to do some more experimenting when I have the time. I would say I was pretty successful in creating a video that utilises transitions of both visual and audio elements, despite myself paying more attention to the visual transitions.
