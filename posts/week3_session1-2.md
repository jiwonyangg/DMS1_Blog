This is the my draft of assignment 1. I haven't yet, properly, worked on the audio (such as the music), however, the visual elements (video) will most likely stay the same. 

The concept and theme of my video is transition and change. I want to show my journey in the past 2 years navigating university and my decision to change courses and the emotions I felt that lead up to my decision to change and how I felt after the change.

It follows a path where it starts off calm but then life becomes repetitive and frustrations arise from the hardships of studying and not being able to understand what I'm learning. This is emphasised through repetition of the study footage. There is a sudden shift in the mood when the study material gets thrown off the table and eases into emotions of nervousness and being lost. This is where it shows my new beginnings at RMIT. I wanted to emphasise that it was scary to make a big change after being in the final stages of my previous degree. I abruptly cut towards the ending of the video to show that the changes have been made and I should just start to embrace my future.

## Feedback
Due to issues with wifi and speakers, I had difficulty joining the class that was conducted through discord on 26/03/24. Feedback was obtained separately by messaging peers. These were the main areas of improvement and key takeaways:

1. Would be good to include diegetic sounds such as when the alarm rings because the alarm appears for a short period of time so it would be a nice addition to use it as a way to break the calmness
2. Music is a bit too loud and feels inconsistent in some areas, might be due to the contrasting style of sound
3. There is a really fast studying cut after one of the shots while panning from the "University of Melbourne" scene. 
4. While the screen is flickering it would be interesting to somehow accommodate the visual elements with the sound
5. It doesn't change the overall meaning and understanding of the video but would be good to include a translation of what the phone call is

## Personal Thoughts and Reflections
Previously, I discussed how I had 2 methods to approach editing. I chose to go with method #1 for this draft and see how I liked just the audio. After feedback and my own personal reflections, I think it would be better to go with method #2, as it emphasises the visual scenes better. This can also be seen with the feedback that I received suggesting to add an alarm ringing sound as it would be able to break the calmness, to show a new cycle/a new day is starting. I believe that this will better enhance the effectiveness of using repetition of studying scenes to evoke frustration.

Another feedback I got was the inconsistent audio level with music. This was the same as when I was experimenting with audio (I chose not to use that experimenting clip because it didn't match up with my footage). However, as previously mentioned, my audio was not yet completely touched up as this is just in the draft stages.

The main takeaway from feedback and repetitive viewing of my draft is to add SFX to emphasise the scene where I want to audience to feel frustration, because it doesn't feel too strong at the moment. This is the most important thing to change for the final submission as I wanted frustration as the main feeling at that point in time and I believe it will juxtapose better with the following scenes, of being lost, (if the SFX can successfully elevate the feeling of frustration). Furthermore, I need to fix up any minor mistakes that were in between the cuts.
