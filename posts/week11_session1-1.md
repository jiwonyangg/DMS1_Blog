# Wireframing
>**Task Outline** 
> 
> In class, we chose one website we visited often and made a wireframe without referring to the website. We made a second wireframe of the same website, except now referring to the website.

## Wireframing Youtube
I didn't have another website in mind other than Youtube, so I just stuck to doing Youtube. I used "wireframe.cc" to make both of the wireframes but I didn't like it so for my wireframes for Assignment 4, I moved to "Figma" instead.
