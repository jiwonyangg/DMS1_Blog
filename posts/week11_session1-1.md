# Wireframing
>**Task Outline** 
> 
> In class, we chose one website we visited often and made a wireframe without referring to the website. We made a second wireframe of the same website, except now referring to the website.

## Wireframing Youtube
I didn't have another website in mind other than Youtube, so I just stuck to doing Youtube. I used "wireframe.cc" to make both of the wireframes but I didn't like it so for my wireframes for Assignment 4, I moved to "Figma" instead.

**Without Looking**

This was my attempt without looking. I think I remembered more than I thought, but I also personally feel like YouTube is relatively easy to remember, in comparison to other websites.

**Reference**

This was the reference image (screenshot) I used. I don't think I did too bad, but again, I personally feel like YouTube was one of the easier websites to do.

**Looking at Reference**

This was the wireframe I did while referring to the screenshot. Comparing the first attempt and this side by side, you can really tell it boiled down to the minor details. Because I use YouTube the most on my PC at home, the layout was actually different to what I was used to. For example, for my first attempt I added the "Shorts" section, which I can see on my monitor at home, but because this was done on my Macbook, it was slightly different. 

But overall, because YouTube is quite easy to remember, there aren't too many major differences.
