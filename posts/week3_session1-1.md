# Editing Sounds into Videos

> **Task Outline**
> 
   > During class, everyone was assigned to a certain group and had to take a continuous 1-minute shot based on a theme. The themes were as follows: a chance encounter, escape, return, alone and a hard goodbye.
   > 
   > Once the videos were filmed we were to choose a video from another group and edit sound onto the footage to enhance the visual elements through editing of sound.

The theme this group chose was escape. I was initially thinking of enhancing the thriller/horror vibe that this video gave but then I changed my direction and decided to go for a lighter, slightly more comedic approach. The most difficult part of this activity was just finding what audio I liked. Matching it up to the video sequence wasn't too bad, although I did still have some difficulties (espcially with the "boing" sound).

I purposely limited the amount of SFX to add because I didn't want to overcrowd the video with information, especially since I used a soundtrack all throughout the video so there was high potential for it to start being too noisy and muddy.

This activity really goes to show how audio makes a huge difference on the visuals that we see and it can really enhance and change the narrative that the visual direction may be going in. I would say I was successful in changing up the mood of the video, since my aim was to make it comedic and seem like hide-and-seek/game of tag, rather than looking like someone is out to murder the girls.
