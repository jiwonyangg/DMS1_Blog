This is the final product that I've produced for Assignment 1. 

This 2-minute film explores the theme of transition and change going through my transitioning and change into a new degree and a new university, through manipulation of audiovisual elements. It aims to display the initial excitement of university life, and realisation that life of pure study isn't the best path for myself - feeling lost. This is then juxtaposed by new beginnings in a new course and university, initially fear-inducing, later being able to embrace a new future that I will have.

## Changes that were made
If you compare the final video with the "final storyboard", it is evident that they are somewhat different. I did mention that I was concerned with the amount of frames, but knew which frames that I didn't necessarily need. This lead me to get rid of frame #14, #26 and #23. Please refer to the storyboards below. 
Another change I made was to limit to amount of audio manipulation. Ultimately, this decision was inspired by the feedback that was received. The feedback suggested to add some sort of audio that could accommodate the flickering. It inspired my decision to limit audio manipulation because I felt as though the less there was in manipulated audio, the more attention and focus I could bring to that climax. 
In the end I chose to combine the sounds that were naturally occurring in my footage (diegetic sounds) and SFX that I found online (alarm ringing and mouse click - diegetic, disconnecting sound - non-diegetic). I actually grew to quite like how the sounds from my footage was discreetly blended in with the soundtracks I chose, hence why I left it in the final.
