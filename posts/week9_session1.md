# Playtesting
>**Task Outline**
>
> The task was to ask friends, family, classmates, etc. to test our 3D environments. We then needed to survey the individuals and collate responses to further iterate our environments.

## Assignment 3 Draft

This was my own "playthrough" (I'm mainly showing all the elements as at this point in time) as I had issues with saving other people's playthroughs.

## Google Forms Feedback

Although participants interpreted it in a slightly different way, it was still in my intentions to deliver the loss in childhood from moving houses/schools so I think my point was still delivered successfully.

Because I decided to use a downloaded First Person Controller, I personally felt that the movements were too fast and wanted to see if other people felt the same way. For the jumps although I do wish that it was possible to fully jump onto the playground equipment, it was to do with the mesh colliders so the character would get stuck even with a higher jump. There was also the issue of if I increased the jump height, then jumping down the chairs would become far too easy. So I ultimately decided that it would be best to keep the jump height as it was.

In all honesty, I wasn't expecting to see this outcome because I made the school quite hidden behiind the house, so I was quite pleased with these results.

The two feedback pinpointed exactly what I wanted to improve/was struggling with. While making my draft I wasn't too sure I wanted to change the lighting, I wanted to make the second have very dull and grey but I was struggling with moving it around so I initially just left it as is, but I can definitely see it being elevated if I'm able to successfully change it. At this point in time I'm not too sure how I want to change it so that the players dont fall off the world so easily. I think that the second world I can raise the edges so it feels more unreal and more like a forest, but for the first portion I think I could try use the fences that the asset came with. I don't think I'll make changes to the hill because the point of the hill is to show a difficult journey.

I mainly asked this question because, although I had an idea of what sounds I wanted, I wasn't sure if it might skew the emotion I wanted to deliver. But after seeing the feedback i now know for sure that adding sounds of an amusement park or playground would really help the first part of my world. So I think I'll definitely add the sounds that I found in the last session, instead of looking for other sounds.

I also asked my sister to do a quick playthough of the world (didn't record her feedback for Google Forms because she didn't want to do it) but noticed that she completely ignored the chairs to jump down and just dropped down from the hill. Although I did tell her to go through it quickly, I wasn't expecting her to completely miss the chairs so I decided that the path up the hill was a necessary change that needed to be made.

I only realised after that I had poorly constructed the multiple choice options, but thankfully my point was still delivered the way I wanted. Based off of this feedback I think I'm going to add slightly more assets, probably more in the school area, and sound is most definitely a must (like previously discussed).

I added this feedback question in case I missed any important questions for my environment but thankfully, I was able to get good responses from all the other questions so it wasn't any new constructive criticisms.
