# Week 1 - Session 1

This was the first photo we took. We didn't know where to start so we went to an area where another team member was more familiar with and found this area that seemed to fit the description.

As we explored the area close to the library we saw a vending machine that dispensed drinks from Japan. This was the most common (it was on multiple floors and corners), and arguably, easiest item to find on the list.

Initally, we walked past the black box room not thinking that it would be an actual room. We walked down the hallway only to go back, realising the sign labelling that it was the black box we needed to find.

After finding the items above, we were very lost and confused where to go next. We walked through the streets and with some searching we came across the hands and realised it was on the list.

Our team continued to just walk while staring at our maps and list for the scavenger hunt, until we came across the Melbourne Gaol. Because there were multiple entrances/doors, we were confused which would be considered the correct one so we took a couple of photos to be sure, hoping that it's right.

The very first hint the class was given was that the map is not a rectangular shape and so while walking we just kept looking around at our surroundings and came across a tower outside the Melbourne Gaol. Although initially the description didn't ring any bells (like all of the other things on the list) as soon as we saw it, it matched the description.

The library was the first place that we stepped into but we were so lost and confused that this installation was completely missed and we walked past it. We walked laps around the entire campus (where the map showed) going up and down, back and forth trying to find anything and then found this installation at the very last minute, before deciding to go back.
