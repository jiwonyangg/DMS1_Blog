# Wireframing for Assignment 4
>**Task Outline**
>
> Using our choice of software, we needed to produce at least 3 wireframes for our planned webpages.

*The greys are just a guide and not the colour palette I'm aiming to use
As mentioned in my previous blog post, I chose to use Figma to design my wireframes, because I found it to be easiest and most accessible to use.

## Wireframe 1

I'm quite worried about the length of the single-scrolling webpage, so my initial thoughts were to do dropdown windows for each of the assignments. I did say that I wanted something more geometric, but I feel like this came to be too rigid and doesn't have enough character. But I think I'll keep the idea of assigning a different colour to each of the projects for easier differentiation. 

## Wireframe 2

I tried out something different and made the artist statement (biography) on the first page and enlarged my logo. I like the enlarged logo idea but I don't think I particularly like having the biography on the first page. I also think that having the buttons to navigate to each assignment as just a colour block makes it less accessible and harder for people to realise that it has a function.

## Wireframe 3

At this point in time, I still wasn't happy with any of the ideas but I chose to iterate further on this. But after a couple of days of thinking, I suddenly got the idea to make the page like webpage pop-ups and anything related to computer files, websites, .txt note files, etc. But it was based off of this wireframe design that I got the idea from. I'm thinking to change the logo and name to be more central and not using a gradient (so I can assign each project a different colour), but other than than I'm going to build my webpage based off of this (but I'm already predicting that it's going to look very different).

## Elements for Blog
- Blue and orange - Complimentary colours and reminiscent of computer (Windows)
- Sticky note/Windows notepad for written documentation
- File icons - Possibly for the pressable buttons
- Photos to look like photo gallery, or random webpage pop-up alerts
