# Brainstorming Assignment 3
> **Task Outline**

> This week's homework task was to watch through Unity tutorial videos and brainstorm ideas for Assignment 3.

## Assignment 3 Idea
Ideas:
1. Going from Primary to Secondary, or the transition of going into VCE
2. Moving schools and houses

I personally don't think that I experienced much change from moving into secondary from primary and Year 10 to VCE, so I'm going to focus on developing the second idea.

The idea that I thought of for the third assignment was to show my experience moving schools and houses. I've only ever moved schools once, which was during Prep so it became a core memory for me because it was the first big change that I can remember and that I was going to experience. Although, I actually didn't move houses at the same time as moving schools, my first couple years adjusting to a new school wasn't fun for me, so my memory merged a lot from when I was around Prep to Year 2. 

> I actually moved houses a couple of times preivously, but since I was too young I have absolutely no recollection. The first time that I can remember moving houses was in late Year 1 or early Year 2 (though I can't exactly remember when).

I chose this experience in my life because I actually went through some uncanny occurrences within the house. I don't particularly believe or don't believe in paranormal activity but I would almost daily, as an 8-year old, get sleep paralysis and wake up within the world of my dreams (it's quite difficult to explain and sounds quite bizarre, especially since I experienced this young so one may believe that I'm just making things up, but to further explain - it was almost like lucid dreaming except that physical changes would be occurring, for example, I almost never was able to go outside of my room once I "entered" the dream world). Although, now I can look back on it and think it was a crazy and different experience, a new school and moving houses within a, sort of, similar timeframe messed with me a lot at the time.

However, I would like to add that at first I hated the idea of moving and I hated my new school (that I ended up graduated from), I ended up really enjoying my school and I hold many good memories and grew to be very attached.

## Rough Sketch of my Environment + Explanations
![Assignment 3 Idea](/W7/map.png)

This was what I was thinking of creating. In the drawing I've visually separated it to be "World 1" and "World 2," however, it will all be connected, but just for the sake of delivery I decided to separate it.

**3D Models, Sounds, Textures, Etc.**
At this point in time, I'm not too sure what sort of 3D Models can be sourced and how sound will properly be incorporated into the project. I do know that I need a lot of buildings and nature, preferably trees, in my world. I would ideally like to include clouds as well, but because I'm still getting used to Unity, I'm not too sure how I'll be able to properly portray it. 

I want my universe to evolve to have smooth textures at the start and slowly get rougher as the user advances through the trail, to show the change in emotion that I felt.

The shapes of the models that I need to utilise in my piece aren't too complicated and are quite blocky (because they're building or building blocks etc.) so the main thing I need to focus on is how the exterior design pattern will be. For World #1 it would mainly need to focus on having bright colours and for World #2 it mainly needs to look like a jail and almost be eerie.

**Explanation of My World**
As seen in the drawing, "World 1" is very child-like, especially with the playground and my proposed colours (at this current stage). If possible, I want to add figures of people, to act like myself playing in the environment. I want to make the figures in this first section of the world green because that was my main school uniform (the other school uniform was blue and white but I want to use brighter colours).

The first "world" will start off with buildings at a lower height, and it will be reminiscent of a playground setting. This is to allow the audience to feel that school and home is a fun space which will slowly evolve to being taller. I want to make the buildings taller and more grey in colour, to express my feelings of sadness of moving schools. 

For the aspect of moving houses, I'm planning on adding a house that's covered by bushes (to imitate the exterior of the house I moved to) and make it as dull in colour as possible. I want to colour this second part of the world with mainly grey and hints of navy blue and gold (as these were the colours of the school I moved to).
