# Making a Greybox Prototype
>**Task Outline** 
>
> This session's homework was to choose an idea to pursue for Assignment 3. Then we needed to make a simple greybox prototype, mapping out using simple shapes where we wanted our assets to be placed.

The images above show different angles for the greybox prototype that I came up with. Looking at it now, I'm actually not happy with the way it looks so I may have to go back to re-design the world. The main part I'm not happy with is I think the path is too straightforward so you can see everything ahead (everything gets spoiled at the start).

I might have to slightly modify the idea of the buildings being really tall in the second half of the environment because it seems like it may become too much of a spoiler. I also feel like the central path is too empty and it feels like "a walk down memory lane" type of situation, so the environment seems very boring.

But in terms of making the actual environment, as I already expected, it was so difficult trying to make the terrain raised and being able to walk through it. The design that's shown above, I actually can't reach the top because there's no way to climb it. I think I'm going to have to explore the functions more because controlling the height is very sensitive. I also found it difficult because of the perspective you draw in isn't the same as it will actually appear. I might experiment with the stamping function for the terrain and make the hill less like a rocky hill and mainly focus on the function of using it as a path to navigate through to the next section of the environment.

I'm glad that I was able to see the prototype before moving onto my actual environment so I can adjust everything I don't like before it gets finalised (which would've been a horrible time if I realised I didn't like it once all my assets were loaded in).

At first (because I'm still getting used to using Unity) I was individually creating each cube for the buildings but I thought it was far too inefficient so I started to copy and paste in groups. I would then slightly adjust the positioning and then I copied and pasted the entire left side onto the right side, making slight position modifications. I wasn't too concerned with the exact positioning or height because I just needed to roughly map out where everything would go.
