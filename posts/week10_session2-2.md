**Assignment 1**

Change: Something different, modified, altered from its original state

I chose to depict my change from lab coats to using Adobe.

I chose to depict my change from transferring into a design degree, coming from a science degree. It starts off with initial excitement of entering university, but slowly turned to madness from repetitive days and not knowing where this repetition was going to lead me. I made the drastic decision to transfer to design, and chose to express my early doubts which later changed to eagerness to learn and anticipation.

This started from drawing out a storyboard to show my journey, choosing where I wanted to film, what I wanted to film and how I wanted to express my feelings from experiencing change and what sounds I wanted. 

Next, the most important step: filming. I filmed whenever I got the chance and spared an entire day to focus on filming all of the scenes I drew out, ignoring what needed to be cut out or not. Of course, this lead to having over 20 minutes of footage, which slowly but surely got cut down to 2 minutes. I added everything onto one sequence and went through over and over which ones didn’t add to the change I wanted to convey.

For sound, I knew what feeling I wanted and what sounds I liked for my footage, but I needed to start searching through to find exactly what my mind was playing. I spent a couple of days searching through various audio libraries, favouriting the ones that fit my video and then favouriting the favourited sounds to reach 3 sounds I was happy with. I was in need of audio that felt optimistic, one that was empty and another that was contempt. 

After combining the sonic and visual components, I felt that you couldn’t fully feel the insanity creeping up from the repetitive days, so I searched for “disconnecting” sound effects, building up gradually to properly express myself slowly breaking down. I also added minor details such as an alarm sound and mouse clicking sound to accommodate the visual scenes the viewer would see.

Finally, after making more minor changes, such as the audio levels and more minor edits to the details I came to the final product: “Change”. 

**Assignment 2**

Freedom: Ability to act without restraint

There were many options to choose from, so I started off by deciding which concepts intrigued me the most. I then brainstormed whatever I could for each of the ones I liked the most. This lead to the final decision of choosing “community.” I settled on this topic because I felt that my ideas were the least cliche, when comparing against the other concept ideas. The final idea was creating icons, for a game, that represented a different interest community from Korean culture, with the flipped icons representing a skin that would be gifted to the user.

After laying out a more detailed plan, I started to draw thumbnail sketches. Through these thumbnail sketches I started gaining a clearer vision on what I wanted to do, so I went straight to vectorising the drawings. Seeing the icons together, I noticed there was less of a symmetrical balance than I had hoped for, so I iterated the icons and made lines less harsh as well.

For colour, I knew I needed red and blue because the main idea behind the icons was based off of Korean culture, so it was only fitting. I attempted to use colours based off of the real-life counterparts, while paying attention to add in split complementary colour palettes. For the first set, visual unity was created by using the same colours across the entire icons sets and for the second, it was obtained through the same “base” icon designs (hanbok).

Sound was both the easiest and hardest part of constructing these icons. I opted to choose sounds that matched the real-life counterparts so it was possible for the user to imagine the sound before it was activated. Although it’s not obvious for the user, I tried to limit the “types” of sounds used so that it wasn’t a complete mess between each icon. Afterwards, it was just a matter of adjusting audio levels, testing, adjusting and testing again.

Following the repetitive testing sessions, I finally came to a completed set of icons: Freedom.

**Assignment 3**

Realisation: blah blah blah

This was by far the hardest project to tackle. I hadn’t touched anything 3D related for many years and my past experience with 3D were simple 3D printing projects. So it was important for me to solidify my ideas to be within my skill level, something I could build.

However, after the grey box prototype I realised, I didn’t like my idea. At all. So, I went back to draw out an updated concept which I was much more satisfied with. 

Then the search for assets began. I gathered all the assets I wanted, keeping in mind the bright colour palette I wanted for the first world and a dark colour palette for the second world. Then I added every one of the assets I found to a new terrain, every last asset. I quickly realised some assets were very much not low-poly so I eliminated the ones that didn’t fit the concept as well, and those that weren’t low-poly.

After, it was continuous modifications, testing, editing, changing, testing again, etc. To finally reach the draft stage. For sounds I knew that I needed the user to feel uncomfortable and eerie, so I had in mind what sounds I wanted, but it wasn’t solidified and I hadn’t found ones that I was envisioning. But I wanted to gain feedback on what the users thought which sounds would suit my world, first, and then add in the sounds.

My approach to sound in this final project was a bit different in the sense that, although it was literal, I made sure that the visual elements with the combination of the audio elements were guiding the audience how to feel, rather than spoon-feeding what the audience should feel, especially because this world had complete freedom in movement thanks to the first-person controller/virtual camera. 

For example, the disconnecting sounds in “Change” was forcing the audience to feel the insanity, rather than being a guide.

Iterating from feedback, and repetition of editing and testing got me to the final destination for “Realisation.”

**Assignment 1**

In this self-portrait film, I invite the viewer to journey through my path of change using audio-visual elements. Initially, I confidently started a career in science, but the repetitive nature of the work quickly eroded my hopes and confidence, leading me to take a step into the unknown and transfer to design. The film is divided into three sections, each defined by distinct soundscapes and visuals: beginning with optimism, moving through emptiness, and ending with feelings of contempt. The aesthetic choices and footage reflect my perspective on the world and how others might perceive my work-life balance, especially in relation to schooling. I focused on presenting the world as it is and the internal dilemmas I faced, which guided my selection and arrangement of the footage. This combination of sonic and visual components resulted in my first video edit: “Change.”

**Assignment 2**

Through this suite of nine responsive icons, the theme of “community” is expressed in a flat-design style. I named this piece “Freedom” to reflect the vast, unending possibilities for interpreting the theme of community. I envisioned community within the context of a game, where each icon represents an interest group inspired by Korean culture. When clicked, these icons allow the user to obtain a skin to be used within the game. Extensive brainstorming and design iterations led to the development of the initial concepts, which were continuously refined to harmonize with one another. The synthesis of colour and shapes provided a foundation for a cohesive audio experience, emphasising the original concepts and ideas behind each icon.

**Assignment 3**

Based on my personal experience with moving schools and houses, this journey of growing up inspired “Realisation,” a navigable digital three-dimensional environment. Unlike my previous pieces, the audio elements in this work guide the user’s emotions rather than merely describing the scenes in the 3D environment. The piece is divided into two segments: the first half illustrates an explorable playground, while the second materialises the emotional experience of moving schools and growing up, enhanced by sonic elements to evoke discomfort and fear. The merging of design principles, spatial design, and 3D design constructed this world, physicalising the emotional transition in parallel with the self-portrait film.

## Refined Artist Biography
Hi I’m Jiwon, pronounced letter “G” and number “1”! I’m an aspiring UI/UX designer, an ordinary student who swapped out pipettes for digital eyedroppers. I focus on 2D environments, making visuals that fit the rules, while keeping my flair for details. My inspiration draws from what I want to change, what I feel could be improved. So join me as I grow my drafts, one pixel at a time!
