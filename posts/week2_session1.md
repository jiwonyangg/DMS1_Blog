# Making a Storyboard
{
   **Task Outline**
   The first portion of the homework task was to select any sequence, a movie, tv show, youtube video etc. The second part of our homework task was to create our own storyboard for assignment 1.
}

## Practice Storyboard
I chose the scene **'Chocolate Room'** from the 2005 Tim Burton film, **'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.'** I drew up to roughly the 1:00-1:02 mark.

Initially, it was very difficult choosing where to finish the practice storyboard but I chose up to roughly 1-minute because after 1-minute there was a slight shift in the story so I thought it would make sense to cut it off there. The sound was the most difficult to describe, moreso because it was just one backing track so I had trouble deciding how to write a description for each frame. Overall this was definitely a good practice before delving into the draft for assignment 1's storyboard.

## Storyboard Draft for Assignment 1

The theme and message I want to convey is transition (not in the editing perspective, rather transitioning in life) and I would like it to seem like a vlog type of video mixed with my point of view (POV). I wasn't too sure about making a film purely about my personality and interests so I decided to go with my life within the past 2 years. I want the audience to get an insight to how I felt like in a degree where it was only studying and how that affected me, and now transitioning into a more interactive and creative degree, in which I have freedom to express my views and passion through my work. Towards the beginning I want the audience to feel calm which later turns to stress/anxiety, transitioning into feelings of being lost and finally being able to let go of my past and walk into the future with a lighter load.

The storyboard will start off with my background of being a "Bachelor of Science" student from 'The University of Melbourne.' I went through 2 years of this degree initially with excitement, later with realisation that I don't want to study for possibly 10 years, in something that I'm not 100% passionate about. I wanted to convey the quarter-life crisis that I found myself in because back in school I was so desperate to graduate as soon as I possibly could that I didn't want to give myself the option of transferring courses because it initially felt like a "waste of time" to me. 

The storyboard shows the initial sequence with an excessive amount of studying, to show how my past 2 years I was bombarded with content and no time, and still feeling like I didn't study enough even when I spent days with pure study. 

As the papers get thrown off the table, this becomes the turning point for change in the film. This symbolises myself stepping out of my comfort zone and deciding to just focus on what I really want to do, rather than what I think would be a good stable career option. This is the point in the film where it switches to my new university life at 'RMIT.'

I purposely made it so that my new 'RMIT' life is portrayed not just "fun" and "happy" but rather a new beginning, so I'm hoping for the audio to instill a sense of anxiety or feelings of being lost. I used the clip of playing music as a way to show this idea of a "new beginning" and added a minor detail that the song is "Time of our Life - DAY6" to symbolise that I may not get another opportunity like this again.

Continuity will be maintained through the chronological passing of time and making sure that the outfits are the same i.e. at the start I'm only wearing my "Bachelor of Science" hoodie and towards the end I'm only in casual wear. I'm going to make sure that the passing of time will show the correct sunrise to sunset, so that the viewer is aware time is passing. The main thing is that I need to pay attention to all the details (including filiming ratio) that are within the shots, especially with placement and how each transition (e.g. fading to black or white) will make sense with the next frame.

## Storyboard Feedback

The biggest idea and takeaway I got from the feedback is one of my peers recommending the studying scene to show myself moving in different positions, as I was explaining how I thought it would be difficult to film for the whole day (as my initial idea was to show the passsing of time through the sun setting). This will definitely be an area to be modified for the final storyboard.

## Storyboard Final

This is the final storyboard that I've come up with after peer feedback. Although along the way and while editing many things may change, this is the overall structure that I would like to follow. 

My concerns for my storyboard, however, is that I've possibly added too many frames to fill within the 2 minute timeframe that we're given. Fortunately, I do have in mind which frames I wouldn't mind taking out (without changing the meaning and theme of my film) to fit within the timeframe.

And although in my storyboard there are a lot of ways sound is manipulated, I'm considering to simplify it more because of the 2-minute timeframe, I don't want my video to be an information overload.

My approaches to editing will be to combine all clips that I have recorded and then go through each clip and cut the parts I want. This way I will go from a very long sequence down to 2-minutes. Afterwards I'll add all the transitions I want to include and then I'll do audio at the very last step so that there aren't any discrepancies. This way it'll be easier for me to convey my theme and concept, without it seeming like there are things that are out of the blue.

The diegetic and non-diegetic sounds and how they will be edited will be subject to change as I want to judge after it's been edited whether I prefer more diegetic sounds or music overlaid.
