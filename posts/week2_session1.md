# Making a Storyboard
## Task Outline
The homework task was to select any sequence, a movie, tv show, youtube video etc. and practice producing our own storyboard to practice for our first assignment.

## Practice Storyboard
I chose the scene 'Chocolate Room' from the 2005 Tim Burton film, 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.'

## Storyboard Draft for Assignment 1
The theme and message I want to convey is transition (not in the editing perspective, rather transitioning in life). I wasn't too sure about making a film purely about my personality and interests so I decided to go with my life within the past 2 years. 

The storyboard will start off with my background of being a "Bachelor of Science" student from 'The University of Melbourne.' I went through 2 years of this degree initially with excitement, later with realisation that I don't want to study for possibly 10 years, in something that I'm not 100% passionate about. I wanted to convey the quarter-life crisis that I found myself in because back in school I was so desperate to graduate as soon as I possibly could that I didn't want to give myself the option of transferring courses because it initially felt like a "waste of time" to me. 

The storyboard shows the initial sequence with an excessive amount of studying, to show how my past 2 years I was bombarded with content and no time, and still feeling like I didn't study enough even when I spent days with pure study. 

As the papers get thrown off the table, this becomes the turning point for change in the film. This symbolises myself stepping out of my comfort zone and deciding to just focus on what I really want to do, rather than what I think would be a good stable career option. This is the point in the film where it switches to my new university life at 'RMIT.'

I purposely made it so that my new 'RMIT' life is portrayed not just "fun" and "happy" but rather a new beginning. I used the clip of playing music as a way to show this idea of a "new beginning" and added a minor detail that the song is "Time of our Life - DAY6" to symbolise that I may not get another opportunity like this again.

## Storyboard Feedback
The biggest idea and takeaway I got from the feedback is one of my peers recommending the studying scene to show myself moving in different positions, as I was explaining how I thought it would be difficult to film for the whole day (as my initial idea was to show the passsing of time through the sun setting). 

## Storyboard Final
This is the final storyboard that I've come up with after peer feedback. Although along the way and while editing many things may change, this is the overall structure that I would like to follow. 

My concerns for my storyboard, however, is that I've possibly added too many frames to fill within the 2 minute timeframe that we're given. Fortunately, I do have in mind which frames I wouldn't mind taking out (without changing the meaning and theme of my film) to fit within the timeframe.
