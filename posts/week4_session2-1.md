## During Class Sketching Activity

It was the hardest for me to choose on what idea to communicate so I just quickly vaguely chose "life." I only ended up with 17 icons (only counted one of the sun icons since it was essentially the same) but I think it was a decent first attempt. 

I feel as though the human heart or the tree roots best represent the theme of life and is the best at being presented as an icon. However, the activity itself was very hard because of the time limit but also I think I chose a difficult theme for myself.

## After Class Sketching Activity

I wasn't satisfied with what I did in class so I did another one after class. This time I was successful in achieving 20 icons within 10 minutes, although I barely finished it. I chose the theme of sealife just to make it easier on myself. 

Out of the drawn icons I think the turtle or the coral reef best represent sea life. Part of the reason I believe these best represent sea life is because in recent years there has been a lot of social media posts saying "save the turtles", whether it be a joke or out of seriousness, or things regarding saving coral reef. Personally, I like the jellyfish most but due to associations across the years the turtle or the coral reef probably better represent the theme.
