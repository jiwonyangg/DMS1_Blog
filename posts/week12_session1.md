# Developing from Feedback
>**Task Outline**

> Continue to develop the webpage, iterating using feedback, getting ready to submit the final webpage.

## Draft Webpage
*I chose to only do the desktop version because the mobile version would be essentially the same, so I didn't want to re-edit the webpages twice

## Main Takeaways From Feedback:
- Colour of logo/name (front page) isn't cohesive with the rest of the page and is a bit bright to look at
- The buttons look a bit messy, potentially due to colour choice
- Makes more sense of project is shown first, instead of the progress first and then project
- Potential to cut down on words, due to repetition (things explained in the artist statement is also in progress documentation)
- Could include a clear ending, seems to end a bit abrupt
- A bit of difficulty seeing the second assignment, due to contrast issues (grey on grey)

## Updated Artist Statement
*Very VERY minor changes
**Assignment 1**

In this self-portrait film, I invite the viewer to journey through my path of change using audio-visual elements. Initially, I confidently started a career in science, but the repetitive nature of the work quickly eroded my hopes and confidence, leading me to take a step into the unknown and transfer to design. The film is divided into three sections, each defined by distinct soundscapes and visuals: beginning with optimism, moving through emptiness, and ending with feelings of contempt. The aesthetic choices and footage reflect my perspective on the world and how others might perceive my work-life balance, especially in relation to schooling. I focused on presenting the world as it was and the internal dilemmas I faced, which guided my selection and arrangement of the footage. This combination of sonic and visual components resulted in my first video edit: “Change.”

**Assignment 2**

Through this suite of nine responsive icons, the theme of “community” is expressed in a flat-design style. I named this piece “Freedom” to reflect the vast, unending possibilities for interpretations of community. I envisioned community within the context of a game, where each icon represents an interest group inspired by Korean culture. When clicked, these icons allow the user to obtain a skin to be used within the game. Extensive brainstorming and design iterations led to the development of the initial concepts, which were continuously refined to harmonise with one another. The synthesis of colour and shapes provided a foundation for a cohesive audio experience, emphasising the original concepts and ideas behind each icon.

**Assignment 3**

Based on my personal experience with moving schools and houses, this journey of change and growing up inspired “Realisation,” a navigable digital three-dimensional environment. Unlike my previous pieces, the audio elements in this work guide the user’s emotions rather than merely describing the scenes in the 3D environment. The piece is divided into two segments: the first half illustrates an explorable playground, while the second materialises the emotional experience of moving locations and growing up, enhanced by sonic elements to evoke discomfort and fear. The merging of design principles, spatial design, and 3D design constructed this world, physicalising the emotional transition in my life, in parallel with the self-portrait film.


## Updated Written Documentation
I shortened down as much as I could because I also felt I was getting too repetitive.

**Assignment 1**

Change: Something different, modified, altered from its original state

I chose to depict my change from transferring to a design degree. The film starts off with initial excitement, but slowly turned to madness, not knowing where the repetition was going to lead me. I chose to express my early doubts in transferring, later building to eagerness and anticipation to learn

This started from drawing out a storyboard to show my journey, choosing location, content and expression of emotions, alongside audio elements.

I filmed whenever I got the chance, filming all of the scenes I drew out, ignoring what needed to be cut or not. This lead to having over 20 minutes of footage, which eventually got cut down to 2 minutes, eliminating those scenes that didn’t express the emotions I felt.

I spent a couple of days searching through various audio libraries, reaching 3 final sounds that fit the visual elements and emotional delivery (optimistic, empty and contempt).

After combining the sonic and visual components, I felt that you couldn’t fully feel the insanity creeping up from the repetitive days, so I added “disconnecting” sound effects, gradually building to properly express myself breaking down. I also added minor details such as an alarm sound and mouse clicking sound to accommodate the visual scenes the viewer would see.

Finally, after making more minor changes, such as the audio levels and more minor edits to the details I came to the final product: “Change”. 


**Assignment 2**

Freedom: Ability to act without restraint

I started by deciding which concepts intrigued me the most, then brainstormed what I could for each of the ones I liked the most. This lead to the final decision of choosing “community” because I felt that my ideas were the least cliche, compared to other concepts. The final idea was one set of icons represented a different interest community from Korean culture, and the flipped icons representing a skin based off of hanbok (traditional Korean clothing).

After laying out a more detailed plan, I started to draw thumbnail sketches. Through this, I started gaining a clearer vision on what I wanted to do, so I went straight to vectorising the drawings. Seeing the icons together, I noticed there was less of a symmetrical balance than I had hoped for, so I iterated the icons and modified lines to be less harsh.

For colour, I knew I needed red and blue because of the Korean flag. I attempted to use colours from real-life counterparts, while paying attention to add in split complementary colour palettes. For the first set, visual unity was created by using the same colours across the entire icons and for the second, it was obtained through the same icon designs, differentiating in colour.

Sound was both the easiest and hardest part, I opted to choose sounds that matched the real-life counterparts so it was possible for the user to imagine the sound before activation. And, I tried to limit the “types” of sounds used so that it wasn’t incohesive between each icon. Afterwards, it was just a matter of adjusting audio levels and further testing.

Following the repetitive testing sessions, I finally came to a completed set of icons: Freedom.

**Assignment 3**

Realisation: Coming to understand, become fully aware

This was by far the hardest project to tackle. I didn’t have experience with 3D software, so it was important for me to solidify my ideas to be within my skill level, something I could build.

However, after the grey box prototype I realised, I didn’t like my idea. So, I drew an updated concept, something I was more satisfied with. 

I gathered all the assets I wanted, keeping in mind the bright colour palette I wanted for the first world and a dark colour palette for the second world. I then added every one of the assets to a new terrain. I quickly realised some assets were not low-poly so, of these assets, I eliminated the ones that didn’t fit the concept as well. 

After, it was continuous modifications, testing and editing to reach the draft stage. I knew that I needed the user to feel uncomfortable and eerie through audio, but I wanted to gain feedback on what the users thought which sounds would suit my world, first, and then add in the sounds.

But my approach to sound in this final project was slightly different. I made sure that the sonic-visual elements were guiding the audience how to feel, rather than spoon-feeding what feeling should arise, especially because this world had complete freedom in movement due to the first-person controller/virtual camera. 

For example, the disconnecting sounds in “Change” was forcing the audience to feel the insanity, rather than being a guide.

Iterating from feedback, and repetition of editing and testing got me to the final destination for “Realisation.”
