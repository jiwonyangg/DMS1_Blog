## Scavenger Hunt Finds
Going into this activity, we had no plans at all and 2 out of 4 of our group mates (myself included) had never explored the campus before. So as soon as we stepped out of Building 9 we paused and stood there for a solid couple of minutes, until one of our group members suggested we go into the library.

**A Study Space Fit for a Sith Lord**

This was the first photo we took. We didn't know where to start so we went to an area where another team member was more familiar with, the library, and found this area that seemed to fit the description.

**A Wide Machine, Dispensing Beverages from a Far Away Land**

As we explored the area close to the library we saw a vending machine that dispensed drinks from Japan. This was the most common (it was on multiple floors and corners), and arguably, easiest item to find on the list.

**A Basement-Dwelling Black Box, Bigger than you might think**

Initally, we walked past the black box room not thinking that it would be an actual room. We walked down the hallway only to go back, realising the sign labelling that it was the black box we needed to find.

**The Disembodied Hands of a Great Ape**

After finding the items above, we were very lost and confused where to go next. We walked through the streets and with some searching we came across the hands and realised it was on the list. And out of the list we needed to find on the scavenger hunt, this was the only thing I knew the location of and the only thing I could help with.

**A Door for the Condemned**

Our team continued to just walk while staring at our maps and list for the scavenger hunt, until we came across the Melbourne Gaol. Because there were multiple entrances/doors, we were confused which would be considered the correct one so we took a couple of photos to be sure, hoping that it's right.

**A Golden Globe Atop a Tower of Eights**

The very first hint the class was given was that the map is not a rectangular shape and so while walking we just kept looking around at our surroundings and came across a tower outside the Melbourne Gaol. Although initially the description didn't ring any bells (like all of the other things on the list) as soon as we saw it, it matched the description.

**A Wide Net Strung Above, Bulging Under the Weight of its Flying Paper**

Even though the library was the first place that we stepped into for this activity we were so lost and confused that this installation was completely missed and we walked past it. We walked laps around the entire campus (where the map showed) going up and down, back and forth trying to find anything and then found this installation at the very last minute, before finally deciding to go back.

## Concluding Thoughts
This was a very difficult exercise, moreso because for me, personally, I was still very new to the campus and hadn't explored anywhere so I felt very useless. It was also very difficult to tell whether or not we were taking photos of the correct items because the descriptions were ambiguous and confusing (which of course would've been made confusing on purpose).
