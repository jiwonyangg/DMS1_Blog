# Brainstorming Assignment 2 Prompts
> **Task Outline**
>
> The homework task was to watch through tutorial videos to introduce Adobe Illustrator and get familiarised with the program. In doing so, the Black Square Activity was required to be completed, if not finished during class time. This part of the homework is documented in "Week 4 - Session 1_1."
> 
> Following these tasks, any brainstorming method of choice was required to generate ideas based off of the proposed prompts for Assignment 2, generating as many ideas possible. This second part of the homework is documented here in "Week 4 - Session 2_2."

## Initial Thought Process
![Starting Thoughts](/W04/3_1mindmap.jpg)

I had a very hard time deciding which prompt appealed to me the most so initially I wanted to brainstorm all the prompts but thought it would be too much of a waste of time so I slightly narrowed it down. I wrote down the list of the prompts and had a think of which ones I could brainstorm the most ideas for. Personally, I found that growth, home, movement, climate and community were of most interest to me. Although I was intrigued by dream and memory, the ideas that I could think of on the spot were too generic and therefore, I thought that I wouldn’t be able to explore my ideas properly and creatively.

## Mindmap - Growth

In my brainstorming for the concept of growth, I started off thinking of which platforms that it could be displayed on and then expanded my ideas from that point onwards. At this point in time I wasn’t too concerned with the specifics such as the detailed platform, context and audience because I was using this as a way to determine which prompt I wanted to go with. I was very intrigued with growth but I didn't settle down on it because I felt that in future development stages it could potentially turn out to be too generic.

## Mindmap - Home

I quickly realised that I was taking too long to brainstorm and had a lack of ideas with the method I was using to brainstorm, as seen by the stark lack of points compared to the following prompts. So after this concept mind map I changed my method to be more free and just jotted down whatever came to mind. At first I thought home would be interesting to explore, but I quickly realised that I didn't have enough ideas to cover 9 (technically 18) icons. 

## Mindmap - Climate

Climate was the start of me changing my method of brainstorm so that I could generate ideas faster, I did still incorporate the platforms for some ideas. Because I'm, sort of, passionate towards issues such as global warming, I initially thought that I would choose climate but I found it difficult to brainstorm for the other 9 set of icons. So at this point in time I held off deciding and chose to continue to brainstorm the remaining concepts I was interested in.

## Mindmap - Movement

Out of the concepts so far, I found that I brainstormed ideas for movement the fastest. I really liked the idea of showing movement through sports but after class, we discussed the icons for the Olympics, I didn't want it to be so similar. Not only this, but, I wasn't too confident in my ability to show movement through flat design, as I'm not too accustomed to flat design.

## Mindmap - Community

To my surprise, I had the most ideas for community and I felt as though I would be able to creatively express myself best through this so I chose this as my Assignment 2 concept. I personally, felt like my ideas for community was the least generic, compared to the other concepts I brainstormed for.

My current plans for the icons are that the icons each represent a certain interest community within a game and once the icon is clicked the user will receive either a skin or a weapon based on their interest community. I got inspired after thinking about how discord has servers so I thought I would make it in a similar way, essentially how people in games will join teams or guilds.

- Platform: PC
- Context: Choosing interest community in a game
- Audience: Late teens - 20’s, People who game/are interested in gaming

## After Class Further Brainstorm

![Ideas for Icons](/W04/3_8list.jpg)

After class thoughts. After being told that the icons should be very specific I went in and now my updated idea is to combine the two of my ideas I had in my brainstorm: ”cultural community” and “game”. I thought that this would be the most interesting and least limiting for me to explore, it was just a matter of choosing which culture to represent. Because I don’t want to potentially misrepresent another community, I chose to just stick with Korean culture, due to my own background being Korean, therefore it would decrease the room for error or misrepresentation significantly.

I also started to brainstorm the specific interest communities for the first 9 icons. My final choices will be: Food, Music, Movies, Traditional Instruments, Traditional Games, Sports, Esports and Architecture.

- Platform: PC, RPG Game
- Context: Choosing area of interest community from Korean culture in a game
- Audience: Late teens - 20’s, People who game/are interested in gaming and Korean culture, can be Korean or just be interested in Korean culture
