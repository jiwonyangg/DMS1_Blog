# My Favourite Space
{
   **Task Outline**
   The purpose of the task was to film a 30 second video of a space that felt important to each individual. This task had to be filmed using a smartphone and it was to be a special physical space other than our own bedrooms. We needed to convey our emotions of how we feel about this space through visual means such as framing.

Due to the restraint being a physical space other than our own bedrooms, I had to choose my backyard. Other than my own room, the only place that I often go to, or go to gaze out, is the backyard to my house. The sky is so pretty when the sun sets and when the wind isn't too strong the sounds of the trees are very relaxing and therapeutic. It's a really good space to just zone out and not think at all, so I chose to film it as my favourite space.
