# Assignment 2 Draft - Coloured Icons
> **Task Outline**
>
> The homework task was to start translating our thumbnail sketches into flat design style icons on AdobeIllustrator.
>
> Then, we needed to create a design using only one hue and keep adding hues until it felt like there was too much. This needed to be done for a total of at least 5 icons with at least 16 colour variations.

## Rough Icon Draft - AdobeIllustrator
![Rough Icon Draft](/W05/DRAFT_ICON.jpg)
These are the rough icon designs that I came up with. I directly traced from my own drawings, excluding the language icon. Now that I'm actually seeing it in a flat design style, although without colour, I think that I could potentially use more detail. Overall, I'm finding that I'm lacking a lot of form for the designs, I'm aware that it should be in the style of flat design, but I feel like it's a bit too empty.

Food - For the food icon I found showing perspective was a bit difficult so I think for the final iteration I'll do it in a bird's eye view instead. Because I'm aiming to show as much symmetrical balance, I think doing it in a bird's eye view will be more successful.

Music - I slightly modified the music icon to get rid of the figures and instead replaced it with microphones. I think that the main stage is lacking a bit of form so I'm considering making the stage 2-tiered to add a bit more dimension.

Entertainment - I'm still feeling unsatisfied with the entertainment icon but after making the icon I thought of the idea to make a film reel design and include the homage within the individual "square" frames of film.

Traditional Instrument - The shapes look too sharp so I'm going to have to focus on adding a bit more detail. I was concerned that it would turn out too detailed but right now I think it lacks a lot of detail, and imagining it in colour (because it will mostly be a brownish colour) it will look even more simplistic, not in a good way. I will also have to scale the icon to be a bit bigger, which isn't a hard issue to fix.

Traditional Game - I'm quite satisfied with how it turned out so I don't believe that this one will change much. If anything, I just need to pay attention to the spacing.

Sports - Because I just traced over my drawing, the proportions and pose look very off so this will need to be reiterated the most. I'll most likely need to re-draw my rough sketch or add some details onto the clothing to make the pose slightly more dynamic. 

Esports - I tried a different style to my initial rough sketch. Because all of my other icons were turning out very sharp and rigid I thought I would try to make the hand signs as if they were shapes. I'm pretty happy with how it looks but I do think I prefer having smoother edges, so I'll have to tweak the individual shapes.

Architecture - I tried to simplify my drawing as much as possible but I want to try develop it to have more detail and see how it looks then. If it looks too detailed then I'll cut down, since it'll only be a matter of deleting elements but I think I want to first compare how it looks more detailed. I also want to see how it will look with bricks on the walls, but I'm concerned that it might potentially add too much detail (but again, it can easily be removed).

Language - I ended up combining all of my rough sketches together, because I didn't want to use ay sort of text. I'm more satisfied than I thought I would be but I want to go for a more uniform pattern instead of having a random number of shapes in each column. I also need to work on making the swirled (?) shape more consistent with thickness.

## Rough Icon Draft - Introducing Hues
![Rough Icon Draft - Introducing Hues #1](/W05/DRAFT_HUE1.png)
For my icons I knew I had to include red and blue, but I wasn't too sure how saturated or how bright I wanted the colours to be but I started off colouring the icons that I knew which colours I wanted to use. I initially started with traditional games because the four vertical sticks are wooden so I wanted to make it brown. I personally thought that it looked good with just brown, and variations of the brown hue that I used but I still tried adding more colour. After adding as much colour as I could, I realised that the green worked really nicely with the brown so I'm planning on incorporating it into my final colour scheme.

For the sports icon, I knew from the very beginning I didn't want to add any colour other than red and blue. However, I did experiment with a new idea of having the background "alternating" the colour that was shown on the uniform, so this is an idea I will continue to adapt. I thought that I would like the aesthetics of a muted colour scheme but I think I prefer it to be more saturated.

I struggled a lot with starting off with one hue for the food icon, because it ended up just looking like mud. So I added as many hues as I wanted but I think the most difficult part of this icon will end up being what background to choose. Because this icon will most definitely use the most hues, I'm a bit stuck on which colour background will help it to look cohesive with the rest of the icons.

![Rough Icon Draft - Introducing Hues #2](/W05/DRAFT_HUE2.png)
Unlike the icons previously coloured, I tried doing no outlines for the music icon and I think it looks much more like a flat design style and it ended up making the icon look cleaner as well. I'm not too sure how I feel about the dots so I'm going to try experimenting with lines instead and see how that turns out, but the colours will be limited as much as possible because I don't want it to lok too messy and end up not working in harmony with my other icons. 

The last icon I experimented with adding hues was the esports icon. I specifically chose this one because I also knew this would be using a limited colour palette, but also, I wanted to test out how the icons would look with the hands being a colour other than skin tones. It didn't turn out as bad as I would've expected, but I think the issue is that it lacks the contrast to make it visually interesting and the more I added hues with different brightnesses and saturations, the messier it got. I also think it will look better if the background is just a a singular colour, because the hands itself will be detailed, in comparison.

I'm still not certain on which colour scheme will work best with my icons but I know I would have to make use of split complementary and possibly triadic (due to red and blue) colour combinations. I was initially hoping to use more muted colours, but it didn't turn out as nice as I thought it would so I think anything more saturated will be better for my icons as my designs will make a lot of use of red and blue, having a stronger contrast will work better.

As you can see in the images, I don't typically go in order. I usually just go for whatever I feel in the moment so that I can boost out more ideas in a shorter span, and think of the others in the back of my head so I don't waste time.
