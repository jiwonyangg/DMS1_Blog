# Assignment 2 Draft - Coloured Icons
> **Task Outline**
>
> The homework task was to start translating our thumbnail sketches into flat design style icons on AdobeIllustrator.
>
> Then, we needed to create a design using only one hue and keep adding hues until it felt like there was too much. This needed to be done for a total of at least 5 icons with at least 16 colour variations.

## Rough Icon Draft - AdobeIllustrator

These are the rough icon designs that I came up with. I directly traced from my own drawings, excluding the language icon. Now that I'm actually seeing it in a flat design style, although without colour, I think that I could potentially use more detail. Overall, I'm finding that I'm lacking a lot of form for the designs, I'm aware that it should be in the style of flat design, but I feel like it's a bit too empty.

For the food icon I found showing perspective was a bit difficult so I think for the final iteration I'll do it in a bird's eye view instead. Because I'm aiming to show as much symmetrical balance, I think doing it in a bird's eye view will be more successful.
