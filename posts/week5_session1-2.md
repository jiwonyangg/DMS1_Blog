# Assignment 2 Draft - Coloured Icons
> **Task Outline**
> The homework task was to start translating our thumbnail sketches into flat design style icons on AdobeIllustrator.
>
> Then, we needed to create a design using only one hue and keep adding hues until it felt like there was too much. This needed to be done for a total of at least 5 icons with at least 16 colour variations.
