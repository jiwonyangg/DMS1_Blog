## HTML Experimentation

![HTML Experimentation](/W05/HTMLEXP2.png)
This was my experimentation of flipping icons. I didn't want to test it yet with my icons because I wanted to make sure that it worked before testing with my own. I only included the most important lines of code to highlight my experimentation with flipping the icons. (I ended up testing swapping my own icons in the next sessions).

At first I was having trouble making my icons flip, but I realised later on that I was actually writing on the wrong page! So I just needed to re-write it in the correct page and then refresh, and it was working as it was meant to.

Although I forgot to document experimenting with size. I was able to successfully change the size without getting any unknown errors. 

> After Week 6, Session 2: With my personal icons, when swapping out I couldn't get my icons to get to the size of 250x250. I tried re-exporting everything but I later found that any other digits would work and succesfully flip, but when it was 250x250, the flipped icon would be distorted.

> The only issue I had with swapping out my icons is that it wouldn't show in the square dimension it was meant to be in. However, this was solved after editing the size of my artboards and re-exporting all of the icons again.

## Assignment 2 Icons Outline
![Assignment 2 Icon Final Outline](/W6ICONS/AT2-01.jpg)

These are the final icon design outlines I came up with. Overall, the icons have become more detailed and I increased the scale for all of the icons, for better visibility. 

Food - From the outline it looks like the icon design is very detailed, but once it's coloured it won't be as messy as the outlines are looking at the moment. There are some portions that I'm ready to eliminate if it becomes too detailed but I hope to keep as much of this design as possible. However, the biggest change I made was the perspective (as I previously mentioned).

Music - I added a couple more tiers for the stage and I changed out the dots (that are meant to act as the fans' lights) for a combination of lines and dots. I also added some more microphones, to make it more obvious that it's related to music. Changing out the dots for lines was more successful than I anticipated because it works around the stage, rather than being random dots.

Entertainment - This was the icon I was never satisfied with but after I got the idea of adding a film reel I think it's much more "elevated" than before. It's a bit more discreet and lowkey than the initial draft that was done in Illustrator so I'm happy with the way I changed it.

Instrument - To this design I didn't make many changes other than the scale and adding a bit more details. But I'm definitely more satisfied with this iteration of the design. 

Traditional Game - I only updated the spacing of the background (which is the board to play the game, after throwing the four wooden sticks) because previously it wasn't equal before. And as mentioned previously, I scaled it to be larger.

Sports - I added a lot more detail to this icon as well and now it has more of the dynamic look that I was after. I also added the central dividing line for the background because I liked it a lot in my experimentation from the hues.

Esports - This stayed the same, other than me updating it to be like actual hands, instead of shapes (like it was previously).

Architecture - I used the same base as the draft icon but I just added more details. Although it looks a lot nicer, I am a bit concerned that it will turn out a lot less like flat design once it's fully coloured, however, I'm planning on changing or eliminating the bricks if that happens.

Language - I made the shapes a bit more obvious that it was Korean, even though they're still technically random shapes. I also updated it so that the columns are the same width and height, which I wanted to adjust from the draft. I also added a mini easter egg! I actually made the first column my name in Korean (지원), and the shapes are still made so that it doesn't look like any words unless you look carefully (and I made it so that you would only be able to tell it's my name only when I reveal the information).

## Assignment 2 Coloured Icons Development
**First 9 Set - Iteration 1**
![Assignment 2 Final Icons Coloured #1](/W6ICONS/AT2_02.png)

This was my first coloured iteration of my icons. I didn't pay attention to the cohesion and harmony of colour yet and, instead, I just coloured it to suit the individual icons. 

Food - I think the background colour washes out the other colours so I'm going to have to make the background colour a bit more saturated.

Music - Now that it's coloured, I definitely think the lines make more sense than the random dots, but the placement of some of the lines bother me so I'll adjust it for the later iterations.

Entertainment - The green colour almost blends in with the grey so I need to change the colour. I want to try making the darker grey slightly darker because I want a bit more contrast with the light and dark grey to balance it a bit more.

Instrument - Although the contrast between the yellow/beige and dark blue is good I feel like it's having the same issue as the food icon (where it seems washed out overall). I'm probably going to try to make the main body of the instrument a darker brown, rather than a very light toned brown. I think the issue is that it's lacking the contrast within the icon itself.

Traditional Game - I'm going to try to darker the brown, similarly to the instrument icon, and try a different colour for the board because it almost blends in together.

Sports - I tried using brighter colours for this icon and it doesn't look bad but I think it doesn't fit the overall aesthetic.

Esports - If the background was a slightly darker, deeper red, it would have a better contrast and the shadows within the hands would be more visible.

Architecture - It turned out too detailed, as I suspected, so for the next iteration I'm going to limit the amount of bricks and then if I still don't like that, I'm going to completely get rid of it.

Language - I don't like the colour combination for the shapes so I'm going to keep playing around with what looks better. I did try to keep the same shapes the same colours, but due to the repetition, it doesn't look good and for me, it's a bit difficult to see the yellow.

**Iteration 2**

![Assignment 2 Final Icons Coloured #2](/W6ICONS/AT2_03.png)

After doing the sports icon in the previous iteration, I got the idea to colour the backgrounds and rearrange the icons to make it look as if it's the Korean flag. So there's only the same red or blue for the backgrounds.

Food - Now that the background has become darker, the colours don't look washed out. I got rid of some minor details, it's not obvious but, I think it looks a bit cleaner.

Esports - Similarly to the previous icon, because there is now an increased contrast, due to the darker background, the hands look less washed out and cleaner than before.

Entertainment - I made the contrast between the two greys a bit darker and now I'm more satisfied with how it looks and I feel like it suits red better (possibly due to the red background and blue contrast from the shirt). I touched up some of the details, which you can't tell, but because I know what I changed it feels more satisfying.

Architecture - I tried to colour one brick from each row, but I think that it looks too randomised so I'm thinking of just resorting to deleting the bricks altogether.

Sports - I made the colours less bright and switched the sides to fit the background looking like the Korean flag. It hurts less on the eyes and fits with the aesthetic of the icons together.

Traditional Games - The four wooden sticks are now easier seen and I think that it's better that the board is harder to see. The board wasn't meant to be the main focal point for the icon so it works out that it blends in a little with the background.

Traditional Instrument - Because there's more contrast within the actual icon, the colours don't look washed out anymore and I feel as though the details are slightly more visible.

Music - I changed some of the positions of the lines and now it works better around the stage, keeping more symmetrical balance.

Language - I turned down the brightness for the shapes and didn't care about the same shapes having the same colours so now it looks less messy (also due to limiting the amount of colours used). I strictly used the colours only within the other icons, not introducing any new colours so that it stays cohesive with the rest of the other icons.

This iteration will be used as the final coloured icons (other than the architecture icon).

**Iteration 3**

![Assignment 2 Final Icons Coloured #3](/W6ICONS/AT2_04.png)

This actually isn't a further developed image, but it was done AFTER the previous, so I decided to keep it in this order. I copied the icons from the first iteration, only changing the bricks from architecture, and the background from sports.

I wanted to see how it would look with a different colour red but I think it turned out too bright so I'm not too happy with the outcome. I also made the background of the sports icon diagonal, to make it more similar to the Korean flag but it makes it seem as if the blue player is winning against the red player and I want it to look neck-and-neck, so the symmetrical balance works better.

I removed the bricks of the architecture icon and now it looks cleaner and more like a flat design icon so I will continue with this version of the icon, with the background of the previous iteration.

Looking back, I'm noticing that the blue backgrounds are actually all a little different so there is slightly less cohesion compared to the last.

**Flipped 9 Set**
![Assignment 2 Final Icons Coloured - Flipped Design](/W6ICONS/AT2_05.png)

Surprisingly, this was actually the first set I coloured. Although I was technically testing as I was going, while I was testing and messing around while colouring, I felt this was the most successful, so I didn't find it necessary to make further developments. 

I either took apart the icons, or I just used the icons as is and placed it on the base of the flipped sets. The colours were quite simple to choose, I tried not to repeat too many colours and I just used whatever suited the original icons. 

For the background, I actually flipped the red backgrounds (in the first 9 set) to be blue and the blue backgrounds (in the first 9 set) to be red, excluding the black background of the sports icon. I wanted to keep the red and blue balance within the icon but I didn't want to do the split background again, so I settled on black.

## Platform, Context and Audience
My original platform, context and audience was:
- Platform: PC, RPG Game
- Context: Choosing area of interest community from Korean culture in a game
- Audience: Late teens - 20’s, People who game/are interested in gaming and Korean culture, can be Korean or just be interested in Korean culture

This is what I'm updating it to:
- Platform: PC, RPG Game
- Context: PC Game UI - Choosing area of interest community from Korean culture in a game, receiving a skin once a community is chosen
- Audience: Late teens - 20's, people who game and are interested in Korean culture (regardless of their cultural background)

## Final Icons - Work Documentation
I kept forgetting to take screenshots throughout, whenever I would get focused, explaining the lack of screenshots towards the end. However, I still tried to take a screenshot whenever I could remember.
