# Development of Assignment 2
> **Task Outline**
>
> Work towards finalising the icons for submission and revisit platform, context, and audience, making changes where necessary.
>
> Watch the provided tutorial videos on HTML and experiment with swapping out the template with the icons that were made.

## HTML Experimentation

This was my experimentation of swapping icons. I hadn't yet tested it with my icons because I wanted to make sure that it worked before testing with my own.
*I only included the most important lines of code to highlight my experimentation with swapping out icons.

At first I was having trouble making my icons flip, but I realised later on that I was actually writing on the wrong page! So I just needed to re-write it in the correct page and then refresh, and it was working as it was meant to.

## Assignment 2 Icons Outline

These are the final icon design outlines I came up with. Overall, the icons have become more detailed and I increased the scale for all of the icons, for better visibility. 

Food - From the outline it looks like the icon design is very detailed, but once it's coloured it won't be as messy as the outlines are looking at the moment. There are some portions that I'm ready to eliminate if it becomes too detailed but I hope to keep as much of this design as possible. However, the biggest change I made was the perspective (as I previously mentioned).

Music - I added a couple more tiers for the stage and I changed out the dots (that are meant to act as the fans lights) for a combination of lines and dots. I also added some more microphones, to make it more obvious that it's related to music. Changing out the dots for lines was more successful than I anticipated because it works around the stage, rather than being random dots.

Entertainment - This was the icon I was never satisfied with but after I got the idea of adding a film reel I think it's much more "elevated" than before. It's a bit more discreet and lowkey than the initial draft that was done in Illustrator so I'm happy with the way I changed it.

Instrument - To this design I didn't make many changes other than the scale and adding a bit more details. But I'm definitely more satisfied with this iteration of the design. 

Traditional Game - I only updated the spacing of the background (which is the board to play the game, after throwing the four wooden sticks) because previously it wasn't equal before. And as mentioned previously, I scaled it to be larger.

Sports - I added a lot more detail to this icon as well and now it has more of the dynamic look that I was after. I also added the central dividing line for the background because I liked it a lot in my experimenting from the hues.

Esports - This stayed the same, other than me updating it to be like actual hands, instead of shapes (like it was previously).

Architecture - I used the same base as the draft icon but I just added more details. Although it looks a lot nicer, but I am a bit concerned that it will turn out a lot less like flat design once it's fully coloured, however, I'm planning on changing or eliminating the bricks if that happens.

Language - I made the shapes a bit more obvious that it was Korean, even though they're still technically random shapes. I also updated it so that the columns are the same width and height, which I wanted to adjust from the draft. I also added a mini easter egg! The first column I actually made it my name in Korean (지원), because the shapes are made so that it doesn't look like any words (and I made it so that you would only be able to tell it's my name and only when I revealed the information).

**Flipped 9 Set**

## Platform,Context and Audience
My original platform, context and audience was:
- Platform: PC, RPG Game
- Context: Choosing area of interest community from Korean culture in a game
- Audience: Late teens - 20’s, People who game/are interested in gaming and Korean culture, can be Korean or just be interested in Korean culture

This is what I'm updating it to:
- Platform: PC, RPG Game
- Context: PC Game UI - Choosing area of interest community from Korean culture in a game, receiving a skin once a community is chosen
- Audience: Late teems - 20's, people who game and are interested in Korean culture (regardless of their cultural background)
