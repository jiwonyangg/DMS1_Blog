## Explanation of My 3D Environment
I wanted to convey my experience of moving schools and houses, and how that affected me emotionally as a child. The change I portrayed was how I was growing up from living an innocent childhood to facing the reality of what life had to offer. I realised from this point in my life that I had to experience change whether I wanted to or not, because life wasn't going to wait for me. This change in my comfortable lifestyle, made me uncomfortable and scared, also due to the "paranormal" experiences I briefly explained in my earlier blog post, and I wanted to express how for a short period in my life, my world felt colourless and like a dead end.
