## Classwork
>**Task Outline**
>
> During class we were assigned to groups and were to navigate to an assigned area without using any form of maps. My group was assigned to go to 'By Korea'.
>
> The second half of this post explores what we learnt, during class, about making terrains and painting textures.

## Navigating to 'By Korea'

**How did it go?**

Our group managed to find the location instantly, thanks to Brian's help, so it went very smoothly and quickly, regardless of the protests that were going on in front of State Library.

**How did you navigate the physical environment?**

I'm not sure about my other group mates but I personally focused on looking at the buildings because I remembered from the map that it was within the area of China Town, so I tried to look for the buildings that I remembered that were within the area of China Town.

**What were the explicit signifiers that you used to find your way? What were the implicit ones?**

We mainly used the buildings surrounding the environment as a way to navigate our way through, other than following Brian. I occasionally looked at the signs but I didn't actually read the street signs (honestly not sure why I even looked at it if I didn't read it but, I didn't read it).

**How did you orient yourself in relation to your destination? How did you know you were heading in the right direction?**

We had an advantage that Brian had already previously been to the location before so he lead the way but I think the best thing was the surrounding buildings. We knew which direction to start off because State Library is a very recognisable building and we had to go down from there (according to the map) and then it was just a matter of heading into the correct "alleyway".

**Is there anything that could have been improved about your spatial journey that would have made it easier, or more enjoyable?**

If I'm being honest, if this was an individual activity, I don't think I would've been able to find it because I have no sense of direction. If it's a place I've been to I'm good at remembering photographically, and if I have a map at hand, but if it's a location I've never been to and I have to remember the map beforehand then I don't think I would be able to find it (especially because this was in an alleyway).

The most obvious thing to make this journey easier is using a map, but other than that I guess having a reward hidden at the location could make it more fun. Or I think it would be interesting to make the locations not in very recognisable areas (such as Muji being in Emporium and By Korea being near China Town).

## Experimenting in Unity
**Practice Results**

Raising the terrain was surprisingly really hard to control and it was very sensitive. I did change the opacity and size but I still felt that it was quite difficult to get the outcomes that I wanted.
