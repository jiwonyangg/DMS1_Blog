## Navigating to 'By Korea'
>**Task Outline**
>
> During class we were assigned to groups and were to navigate to an assigned area without using any form of maps. My group was assigned to go to 'By Korea'.
How did it go?

How did you navigate the physical environment?

What were the explicit signifiers that you used to find your way? What were the implicit ones?

How did you orient yourself in relation to your destination? How did you know you were heading in the right direction?

Is there anything that could have been improved about your spatial journey that would have made it easier, or more enjoyable?
