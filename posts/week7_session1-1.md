## My Solar System

I didn't think about being creative with making my solar system because I was having so much difficulty trying to get used to using Unity. Although I wanted to try out something unique, I was too focused on trying to get things to work and changing perspectives etc. that it didn't cross my mind to make a different planet (other than the existing planets in the solar system).

Because I didn't bring my mouse to class, controlling the perspective was very difficult and I would struggle a lot with trying to move around the 3D objects as well. I tried as hard as I could to avoid using the trackpad, so I chose the scale of the object and location with the functions in "Inspector."
