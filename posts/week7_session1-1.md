## My Solar System

I didn't think about being creative with making my solar system because I was having so much difficulty trying to get used to using Unity. Although I wanted to try out something unique, I was too focused on trying to get things to work and changing perspectives etc. that it didn't cross my mind to make a different planet (other than the existing planets in the solar system).
