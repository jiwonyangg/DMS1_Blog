## Changes After Initial Greybox Prototype
![updatedmap](/W8/updatedmap.png)

These are the changes I decided to make after seeing my greybox prototype. I didn't like that you could easily see the path and, therefore, get spoilers of what was to come so I modified it so that the user would climb up a hill and then be faced with a drop. I'm still deciding between whether I want the user to freefall, or to jump down platforms, but I'm leaning more towards having platforms. 
> In class we learnt straight, oblique and spiral paths. I didn't like that my path was TOO straight in my original sketches so I modified it so that it's not too obviously straight.
By doing this, I'm preventing any spoilers and I think it's more interesting to my environment as well. I'm also going to make the environment more "randomised" rather than having everything lined up along the two sides of the terrain, which is quite boring and uninteresting (like I mentioned earlier too much like a walk down memory lane). I also realised after class, that the original world I drew up, didn't have a clear enough starting point, one could argue that on top of the hill would be the starting point, so I didn't feel like it hit the requirements for this assignment.

For the sky, although the second half of the terrain will be very eerie and almost scary, I'm choosing to have the sky bright and sunny to insinuate that the problem was within me and not my surrounding elements. By making the sky bright and sunny I'm choosing to show the audience that everything around me is actually normal and what I perceive was as a result of how I felt from the sudden changes that were happening in my life. I also wanted to keep the sky sunny because, in my very first explanation I mentioned that I was the only one in my family that was experiencing weird things in the new house, so I wanted to further emphasise that I was the problem (regardless of what happened to me).

I'm choosing to have the start of the world more obviously like a young kids childhood, so that the user is free to interpret it as moving into the reality of school, or changing schools/moving houses because the change I wanted to express encompasses the two (and it's quite intertwined with each other).

## Searching for Assets
I initially opened up unity and made a terrain but without my assets I was having a hard time deciding what size would be ideal and where I wanted to stop the hill etc. So I changed my method and decided to search for all my assets before moving into unity. I only screenshotted a couple of my process of finding assets because it became very repetitive. At this point in time I was exclusively using "SketchFab" to find all of my assets, but later on I found some very useful ones on the Unity Asset store as well.

## Getting Started in Unity

I started to import ALL of the assets I downloaded into the terrain, because I wanted to see what it looked like and to see if my computer could handle it all. I'm glad I did this because I quickly discovered that a lot of the assets I had downloaded needed me to manually add the textures and I found that some of the assets I was planning on using didn't come with the full set of textures so it looked quite incomplete. It also took a decent amount of time trying to recolour every individual asset (that didn't load in with textures), but I was able to judge which ones I liked and didn't through this process, as some of them didn't work harmoniously visually.

I started to draw the terrain (after hiding the assets on the scene) but this was later scrapped and re-done because I wasn't happy with the way it was turning out to be.

![pt1](/W8_WIP/1bplaytest5.png)

I would playtest in between to test whether the character would be able to move through without jumping, because initially I wanted the user to struggle getting up, instead of having the easy way out of jumping up the hill.

![pt1](/W8_WIP/1bplaytest6.png)

This was one of the assets I got rid of because after Sam's crash course on Unity, I realised it would look much better if I used the terrain function to draw in the trees, rather than an asset. I also thought that it would help the world load faster, as this asset wasn't necessarily low-poly.

The rest of the images just show me modifying and moving around the assets where I wanted them to be placed. And in between you can see the sudden change in the terrain, which was after Sam's crash course on Unity, I realised I wasn't using the functions to their fullest potential.

I stopped developing my world for this session at this point in time because I started to think everything looked the same and was beginning to not like anything, so I decided I needed to get a break and continued on in the next session.
