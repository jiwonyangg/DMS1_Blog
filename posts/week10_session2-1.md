This is my first time using Figma but it's quite similar to AdobeIllustrator so I didn't have too much of a hard time using the functions. But I am aware there are a lot more new functions that I'll have to learn (especially with the prototype interactions).

Because this webpage was just a practice, I chose random colours and gibberish ("Wee Woo"). At this point in time, I'm not sure about which direction I want my webpage to head towards, so I tried using red, which is a colour I've never used as a main colour for a graphic design choice.
