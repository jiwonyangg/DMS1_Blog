# Assignment 2 Thumbnail Sketches
> **Task Outline**
>
> To prepare for Assignment 2, the homework task was to do 5 sets of rough sketches for each of the 9 icons, totalling to at least 45 thumbnail sketches based on the chosen concept.

## Thumbnail Sketch - Food

I decided to do 6 sketches each instead of 5 to challenge myself. For food I started off by drawing Shin Ramyun (a Korean instant noodle) but thought I wouldn't want to use an actual brand for my icons so I quickly shifted my direction. I drew kimbap, bibimbap, tteokbokki, gujeolpan and rice cakes. My main focus was to make sure that there was a certain focal point, I tried a different approach for the fourth thumbnail (tteokbokki) by not making it a central focal point but I didn't like it so I switched back to having the focal point centered. 

I'm thinking of doing bibimbap (third thumbnail sketch) because it's a more recognisable dish while not being a very cheap food (like tteokbokki being a street food). I purposely added colour for the thumbnail because it looked really confusing and seemed to be all scribbles. Although it almost looks textured, I don't plan on adding any textures.

## Thumbnail Sketch - Music

The theme of music was the hardest to express so it took the longest to brainstorm. Because K-Pop is the most well-known of Korean music I tried to express it as best as I could without singling a certain group since I want to make it a community for interests. I attempted drawing silhouettes the most but it wasn't as successful as I wanted because it seems too specific and exactly what I tried not to do - singling out groups.

The fifth thumbnail (depicting a concert scene) felt least specific to a group so as of now, I'm thinking of choosing the fifth one. I went a different approach and tried to see if I could play around with positive and negative space, which it actually doesn't but I came out with something I'm surprisingly feeling okay with. However, colour is going to be very important in attempting to convey the aesthetic of concert lights.

## Thumbnail Sketch - Entertainment

Although in my previous post I labelled this theme as movies, I decided to name it more broadly entertainment to include dramas. I first thought of which Korean movies or dramas were popular and then started off from that point. The very first thumbnail sketch is essentially an homage to 'Parasite' since it is one of the most well-known Korean movies. I wanted to show that I'm expressing the people as shapes as well with only the black bar, because the black bar made the movie poster recognisable, but it's hard to tell because it's a thumbnail sketch. 

I tried a some different approaches such as the second sketch showing a scene through the perspective of a camera but I think it's not specific enough for it to be considered related to Korean culture. Overall, I tried my best to play around with line and shape, trying not to straight up draw people but it proved to be quite difficult as I found myself forgetting to create a clear focal point (I thought this was important for this assignment because I feel that this is the clearest way to express flat design icons). I haven't fully decided yet, but I want to somehow incorporate the first thumbnail as the icon, although I want to change it up so it's not just a copy of the movie poster. 

## Thumbnail Sketch - Traditional Instruments
![Theme: Traditional Instruments](W04/5_4instrument.JPG)

For the first sketch I just started drawing without thinking to start getting more ideas for this theme. I learnt from this sketch that I should really try to simplify the image into shapes and get rid of any deatil so I kept this in mind for the remainder of the thumbnail sketches. I kept in mind that I was choosing something circular for food so I wanted to show cohesion and do another set of sketches that were more circular and had a more central focal point.

I personally like how the third thumbnail sketch turned out to look so I'm planning to further develop this one. The third sketch seems like the best option to simplify into shapes with the inclusion of lines, without having a simple, and potentially boring, single cirle shape.

## Thumbnail Sketch - Traditional Games
![Theme: Traditional Games](W04/5_5games.JPG)

I wanted to contrast from all the circular elements that I kept using throughout the other sketches so I opted to go with sharper shapes, mainly squares. The main thing I kept consistent was trying to keep a central focal point and making sure I don't use too many lines and try to keep the icons limited to shapes, since it will be done in a flat design style.

Although I really liked the way the third sketch looks, objectively, I don't think anyone would be able to guess that it's a Korean version of paper-scissors-rock (mook-jji-bba) so I'm choosing to go with the first sketch instead. Because the overall shape is a square, it contrasts with the other icons, like I wanted it to. Unlike the other icons, this design is a lot more simple and uses a lot less shapes as well but I may have to trial further how to make the four sticks more visible.

## Thumbnail Sketch - Sports
![Theme: Sports](W04/5_6sports.JPG)

This one was the easiest for me to make my decision because I liked the symmetrical balance the second sketch includes and the contrast between the red and blue is a good way to incorporate elements of the Korean flag (as well as it being a part of Taekwondo). 

Compared to the other themes, I focused a lot less on having a centred focal point but looking at the sketches combined the second sktech definitely stands out more due to the symmetrical balance, as previously mentioned. I also wanted to challenge myself by having a slightly more complicated design so that I can further dissect the subjects into shapes to achieve the flat design style.

## Thumbnail Sketch - Esports
![Theme: Esports](W04/5_7t1.JPG)

Esports in general has been quite big and popular in Korea over the years, however, the popularity of 'League of Legends' in Korea is significantly greater than other esports genres. And although it is true 'League of Legends' as esports itself is very popular in Korea, it is more popular because of a player, 'Faker', and the team he plays for 'T1' so I decided to focus more on 'Faker' and 'T1', rather than the game itself. I tried both a generic and predictable approach and also a more "niche" approach. I ended up not paying attention, at all, to the generic approaches because it felt way too predictable.

For some reason, I really liked the sketches of the hands in the 'Traditional Games' sketch so I attempted to do the same with esports, drawing each T1 players signature hand signs, and I ended up enjoying the way it looks a lot so I'm deciding on going with the third sketch. The fourth sketch needed text for the player's uniforms so I wanted to avoid it, even though I thought it represented T1 well (as they won "Worlds 2023"), although it technically doesn't give hints on what the icon is, I thought it was safer to avoid it due to the restrictions of the brief. Similarly to the Taekwondo icon, the symmetrical balance of the third sketch really drove my attention to it and I think it'll be really fun to play around with colour for this as an icon.

## Thumbnail Sketch - Traditional Architecture
![Theme: Traditional Architecture](W04/5_8architecture.JPG)

For this theme I tried to challenge myself and try expressing architecture through patterns, as seen with the third and fourth sketches. Although I don't mind how it turned out, I don't think that it's the best fit for an icon. I also tried showing modern architecture but because I did traditional games and traditional instruments I thought that it would be better to just go down the traditional aesthetics route. 

Because I'm deciding to stick with having a central focal point, it was almost inevitable for me to pick something with more symmetrical balance, so I've decided to go with the fifth sketch. I also felt that the first had nothing to do with architecture and the second would be too detailed even if I simplified the shapes, the details wouldn't shine through. So, I settled with the fifth option and because it's a gate/door it could also almost seem like it's opening the icon as it flips to the next icon (depending on the sound design).

## Thumbnail Sketch - Language
![Theme: Language](W04/5_9hangul.JPG)

Although I'm most satisfied with the fourth sketch I still haven't settled with any design because of the inclusions of the Korean language I feel like it goes against the brief. I'm choosing to develop the fourth or the fifth one but at this stage I think I'm still stuck on how I want to express language.

An idea I do have, however, is because this is flat design and shapes will be the main element of focus I could somehow manipulate the shapes into looking like the Korean characters, since many Korean characters already look like shapes. But the main focus is to avoid type as much as possible to completely avoid the restriction stated in the brief.
