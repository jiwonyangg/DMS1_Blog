## Finding Sounds for Icon Designs
These were all the sounds I found that I felt suited my icons. There are some that have multiple options but I'm deciding to choose while editing in AdobeAudition.

**Food**

- Sneakers Run Wood -- Youtube Audio Library -- https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary -- License: Youtube Audio Library License (No Attributions Required)

I found it difficult to find a good spot to cut the audio so that the sound is short for the second sound option, so I opted to go with the first sound effect.

**Esports**
- MWP Gaming Keyboard short.mp3 by zajichavez -- https://freesound.org/s/629619/ -- License: Creative Commons 0
- Keyboard Typing Fast Close -- Youtube Audio Library -- https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary -- License: Youtube Audio Library License (No Attributions Required)
- Typing on Keyboard -- Youtube Audio Library -- https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary -- License: Youtube Audio Library License (No Attributions Required)

I found that the audios found on Youtube Audio Library was a bit too quiet so I went for the first option. It was also quite obvious that the sounds of the keyboards were keyboards used in offices (assuming they were membrane keyboards) so it was more fitting to use the actual gaming keyboard sound.

**Entertainment**
Film Projector - Long Run with Finish by Stefan021 -- https://freesound.org/s/412145/ -- License: Creative Commons 0

I had the hardest time trying to find a sound for entertainment but I realised it would be fitting to have a film projector sound since my icon includes the design of a film reel. I just need to find the right timing to cut off the audio because this is the longest audio that I found.

**Architecture**
- Wood Door Close and Rattle -- Youtube Audio Library -- https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary -- License: Youtube Audio Library License (No Attributions Required)
- Wood Door Open and Close Series -- Youtube Audio Library -- https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary -- License: Youtube Audio Library License (No Attributions Required)
- Dumpster Door Slam -- Youtube Audio Library -- https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary -- License: Youtube Audio Library License (No Attributions Required)

I quite like the sound for all of these choices but I'm leaning more towards the top two because the third one has a metal/steel door sound (understandably since it's a dumpster door slam) so it's not fitting for my wooden gate icon design.

**Sports**
- Swoosh -- Youtube Audio Library -- https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary -- License: Youtube Audio Library License (No Attributions Required)

I thought that it would be interesting to use this sound because it's almost like the sound of a kick but I'm going to have to reduce the volume a lot because it's currently too loud.

**Traditional Games**
- Wooden Bat Dropped on Ashphalt -- Youtube Audio Library -- https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary -- License: Youtube Audio Library License (No Attributions Required)
- Wood Bat Falling in Dirt -- Youtube Audio Library -- https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary -- License: Youtube Audio Library License (No Attributions Required)
- Wood Bat Falling in Grass -- Youtube Audio Library -- https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary -- License: Youtube Audio Library License (No Attributions Required)

The game itself is throwing wooden sticks and seeing how it lands, which determines how many steps you can move on the board, so I thought these three sounds were perfect. I think the third one is a bit quiet but because I can edit the volume I'm not too concerned about it yet.

**Traditional Instruments**

I tried my hardest trying to find a sound that was similar to the actual instrument and I came across this sound so I immediately downloaded it to use for my icons.

**Music**

At first, I was considering adding screams but I wanted a more "UI" type of sound so I had the idea of adding a camera snap sound because at concerts many people will record so I thought it would make sense.

**Language**
Writing with pencil 2 by fthgurdy -- https://freesound.org/s/376705/ -- License: Creative Commons 0

This was an easier sound to find because I knew I wanted something to do with pencil sounds, so I found this writing sound and added it to my icons.
