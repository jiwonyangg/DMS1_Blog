# Draft Video


ATTRIBUTIONS
This is the my draft of assignment 1. I haven't yet, properly, worked on the audio (such as the music), however, the visual elements (video) will most likely stay the same. In the initial stages while drawing up the storyboard, I wanted to combine both diegetic and non-diegetic sounds. However, after editing I wanted the music to convey the emotions more than using the diegetic sounds, and I didn't like the audio that was recorded (although there was always an option of obtaining copyright-free audio).

## Feedback
(Due to issues with wifi and speakers, I had difficulty joining the class that was conducted through discord on 26/03/24. Feedback was obtained separately by messaging peers.)

1. Would be good to include diegetic sounds such as when the alarm rings because the alarm appears for a short period of time so it would be a nice addition to use it as a way to break the calmness
2. Music is a bit too loud 
3. There is a really fast studying cut after one of the shots while panning from the "University of Melbourne" scene. 
4. While the screen is flickering it would be interesting to somehow accommodate the visual elements with the sound
