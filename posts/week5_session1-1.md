# Pen Tool Activities
> **Task Outline**
> In class we did a game to help improve our pen tool skills and had some more worksheets to follow in AdobeIllustrator to further refine our pen tool skills.

## Bezier Game

This was the final score I got in the game. At first I tried as hard I could to get the least number of nodes as possible but it got too difficult so I focused more on how the shape appeared rather than the amount of nodes that I used.

I can't tell if it's because of having used the pen tool before or because of the game, the pen tool activities were actually done very quickly and I purposely changed the colours to show the line that I traced.
