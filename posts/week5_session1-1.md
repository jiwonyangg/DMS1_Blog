# Pen Tool Activities
> **Task Outline**
> In class we did a game to help improve our pen tool skills and had some more worksheets to follow in AdobeIllustrator to further refine our pen tool skills.
> After class, there were further tracing activities to do to help understand flat design. Out of the provided Edward Hopper paintings, 2 were to be chosen, one being traced with the pen tool and the other using the shape tool.

## Bezier Game

This was the final score I got in the game. At first I tried as hard I could to get the least number of nodes as possible but it got too difficult so I focused more on how the shape appeared rather than the amount of nodes that I used.

## Pen Tool Activity #3

I can't tell if it's because of having used the pen tool/AdobeIllustrator before or because of the game, but the pen tool activities were actually done very quickly and I purposely changed the colours to show the line that I traced. 

The exercises helped me to get back into using the shortcuts and I found that I got faster with each exercise (and throughout the game as well).

## Edward Hopper Tracing Activity

I didn't notice while I was tracing the image but there are some white gaps peaking through. Although it wasn't a requirement to do it fast, I tried to do it relatively fast because I felt as though the more I pondered on how to do it, the less it would turn out in a flat design style. This was my very first attempt doing a full coloured tracing in a flat design style so I don't think it turned out too bad. 
However, I did have a lot of difficulty trying to decipher the paintign, especially the hills so I'm not particularly happy with the nature but I think the lighthouse turned out much better than expected. At first, I thought that using the pen tool and organic shapes would be difficult but having done the exercise it allowed for more freedom and I could manipulate the shapes however I needed it to be.

I specifically chose this painting because I thought it would best work with the shape tools and although it does seem a lot more simplistic to do compared to the others, it was still a very difficult task. The biggest difficulty I came across was similar to the one above, I had a lot of trouble trying to understand the image and what detail was depicting what. Compared to the pen tool tracing, it's a lot worse visually and I would say that it was a lot more difficult to do. 
Looking back now, I think this one could have potentially used some more detail because it's almost hard to tell what the traced image is trying to show. Although the aim was to depict it in a flat design style, I personally think that it turned out too flat.
