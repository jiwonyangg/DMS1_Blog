# Black Square Activity
> **Task Outline**
>
> The homework task was to watch through tutorial videos to introduce Adobe Illustrator and get familiarised with the program. In doing so, the Black Square Activity was required to be completed, if not finished during class time. This part of the homework is documented here in "Week 4 - Session 1 (1)."
> 
> Following these tasks, any brainstorming method of choice was required to generate ideas based off of the proposed prompts for Assignment 2, generating as many ideas possible. This second part of the homework is documented in "Week 4 - Session 2 (2)."

**Reflections**

Design thinking includes: empathising, defining, ideating, prototyping and testing. In this activity, ideating was the key focus out of the elements of design thinking. The aim of the activity was to brainstorm as many solutions to the prompts given, however, it goes without saying that prior to ideating defining was crucial in order to understand what was needed to be delivered. 

At first, I tried to go in order of how the prompts were given but I quickly got stuck on producing different looking designs for the one prompt. I also found it very difficult to define what the prompts needed because I wasn't sure how the squares would be able to properly represent those words. So I very quickly changed my tactic and went in any random order that I wanted to go in because I felt that this was the fastest way for me to produce thumbnail designs (as the point of this exercise was to be fast at brainstorming).

Although the homework task asks how we applied what we learnt from the LinkedIn videos, as I finished this activity in class I watched the videos after. Thankfully, I had prior experience with AdobeIllustrator so the videos were recaps for me and the black square activity didn't really require much technical illustrator skills.

## Black Square Activity - Final 6 Designs

These were the final designs that I chose, that I felt best represented the given prompts. I paid attention to how the designs fit the prompt but also whether there was potential that a design could be misunderstood for another prompt, due to any visual similarities.

As mentioned previously, I started to do things in a very spontaneous manner. Occasionally, I would make a design but then observe and realise that it fits another prompt better than what it was made for.
