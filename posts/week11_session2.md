# Developing Assignment 4
>**Task Outline**
>
> Evaluate what elements of the webpage could be made more accessible and continue to work on developing the webpage.

## Accessibility 
I lost the screenshots of me checking the colour contrast on WebAIM's Contrast Checker, but I chose the lighter blue, grey and light orange based off of the contrast with black (as this was the colour of my text). 

I noticed that having images on top of images made things not as clear so I added the drop-shadow effect where I could.

Because I have some interactions included into my webpage, I decided to add things like "hover over me" or "click video to watch", so that it's made clear to the user all of the functions on the webpage. I didn't include "click me" for the navigational buttons, but instead I made the text AND the shape clickable so that the user doesn't need to move all the way to the shape to click.
