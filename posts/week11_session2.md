# Developing Assignment 4
>**Task Outline**
>
> Evaluate what elements of the webpage could be made more accessible and continue to work on developing the webpage.

## Accessibility 
I lost the screenshots of me checking the colour contrast on WebAIM's Contrast Checker, but I chose the lighter blue, grey and light orange based off of the contrast with black (as this was the colour of my text). I tried to avoid having text not being black because I thought that it would mess up the cohesiveness overall, and I personally don't really like text that's not black (when there are a variety of other colours that exist on the same page). I tried to make the text that's not important/just a random design detail grey.

I noticed that having images on top of images made things not as clear so I added the drop-shadow effect where I could. This helped a lot with visibility, especially with the brainstorms I had for Assignment 2, before it almost merged together, but after the drop-shadows you could actually differentiate the images from each other (edges of the images).

Because I have some interactions included into my webpage, I decided to add things like "hover over me" or "click video to watch", so that it's made clear to the user all of the functions on the webpage and so that the user knows where the link will take them. I didn't include "click me" for the navigational buttons, but instead I made the text AND the shape clickable so that the user doesn't need to move all the way to the shape to click.

I also made sure that the text was structured the way I wrote it. So the way it's currently structured, as you scroll down, it's the order that it should be read (pretty self-explanatory).

## Work Documentation
Because I still wanted a relatively, geometric design, I opted to not include organic shapes. Usually, I actually prefer symmetrical balance but because I wanted to mimic the look of having multiple tabs/windows opened (which I always do on my own devices) I overlapped a lot of the elements.

I also limited the colour palette, but used blue and orange because, my mind associates blue with Windows (which is the primary operating software I use but I wanted to combine the visual elements with macOS because that's what I've been using for this course) and orange because it's a complementary colour and I think of blue and orange when I think of error messages (even though orange isn't usually involved). I included black and white for better contrast and to balance it against the orange and blue.

A minor detail I tried to maintain was the spacing. I thought that this would be more visually appealing and maintain the balance across elements and it was an easy way to avoid creating a hierarchy, because I didn't want one project to look more important than another, so the hierarchy is only evident with the starting logo and my name.
