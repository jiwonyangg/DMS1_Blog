# Final Icon Designs - COMMUNITY
My idea for the concept of community was that the website would be the UI for a PC game and the first 9 icons would each be depicting a different interest community. Users will then decide which interest community to join (and have the freedom to hover over to have a sneakpeak of the skins) and once the icon is clicked, the sound will signify that they have received the skin (which are the flipped icons).

- Platform: PC, RPG Game
- Context: PC Game UI - Choosing area of interest community from Korean culture in a game, receiving a skin once a community is chosen
- Audience: Late teens - 20's, people who game and are interested in Korean culture (regardless of their cultural background)

This is my final icon design I chose for Assignment 2.

**Flipped 9 Set**

These are the final flipped designs for my icons for Assignment 2.

The final background colour I chose for my website was a grey colour. I tried black at first, but the flipped icons would blend in too much so I changed it to a grey.
